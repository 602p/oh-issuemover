Thanks for submitting this\npatch; reorganizing our dependencies makes OpenHatch's code easier to understand\nfor others and myself in the future!\n\nAnd hopefully for you as well! See you on future tickets.

If the tests pass, ship it! (If not, say so, and the next\nstep would be upstreaming our patches to the patch.py library until our tests\npass with upstream code.)\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}]}
