Add the blog and bugtracker sites and maybe the mailing list.\n* revise the Company Overview to reflect the current direction for OpenHatch.\n* get some screenshots up to populate the Photos section, and pictures from meetups, if those \nhappen.\n* occasionally write status updates reminding people about the weekly meetings, and highlighting \nimportant new features (the training missions would be perfect).\n   \n", "author": "jesstess"}, {"message": "I agree!\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "Facebook activity for OpenHatch is pretty low.
