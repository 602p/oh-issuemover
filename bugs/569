The IWH button should only appear if you're not already marked as a\ncontributor to the project.\n2.)

When you click the IWH button, an optional form field should appear asking\nwhat sorts of things you would be interested in helping with. This extra\ninformation would then appear for current maintainers in the 'prospective\nhelpers' contacting interface.\n4.) After you click IWH, a rectangular green badge saying \"I want to help\"\nshould appear in the place of the button.\n5.) If you are marked as a contributor of a project, a rectangular blue badge\nshould appear saying \"I am a contributor\" (above where the maintainer button\nappears).\n6.) If you click the maintainer button, a rectangular orange \"I am a maintainer\"\nbadge should appear in place of the button (below the contributor badge).\n\nOptional: Asheesh suggested having an overlay that appears after you click the\nIWH button, before even the optional extra field appears, where maintainers can\nwrite a special note to IWHelpers.\n   \n", "author": "aldeka"}]}
