This is a CSS file, \nnot a Python file, so it's not *critical*, but in the future try to stick to \njust spaces.\n\n3) I'm shipping this.\n\n4) Wow, the wiki sure does look more OpenHatch now!\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "True. +1 for me then.

I think it's still too light. \nLight orange for links but the main site uses a reddish orange (#FF6D3D). Why not \njust use that? Was it too light for all those links?\n\nI really like, as I said last night, the hatch background. Big improvement :) Why \n#f9f9f9 as fallback color and not main site's #ffffff? Maybe the main site and wiki \nshould fall back to a pale blue (like eafcfe)? (so we keep similar color scheme if \nthe image doesn't load)\n\nI dig the rounded edges. Very hip. \n\nUncreated pages are red so that would be too close with the #FF6D3D color so I'm not \nsure there. I like red cause it's normal wiki \"this doesn't exist\" but it's pretty \nclose to the reddish orange of main links on main site. Maybe it's time for your \npurple. ;) Or 8F2400? \n\nThis overall is definitely an improvement from the default wiki look. :)\n   \n", "author": "jessica"}, {"message": "Ok, this is last, I promise. - Just a small change to the location of the top-left \npersonal navigation items.\n   \n", "author": "palhmbs"}, {"message": "Patch file updated.\n   \n", "author": "palhmbs"}, {"message": "Ok, this IS my final revision.\n\n@-moz-document domain(\"openhatch.org\") {\n body {\n\tbackground: #f9f9f9 url('<a href=\"http://openhatch.org/static/images/motif-\">http://openhatch.org/static/images/motif-</a>\neee.png') repeat !important; \n        color: black !important;\n \tmargin: 0 !important;\n \tpadding: 0 !important; }\n a { \tcolor: #eb7f04 !important; }\n a.new {   color: #BA0000 !important; }\n.pBody, #content, .ca-nstab-main { border-top-left-radius: 8px; border-top-right-\nradius: 8px; border-bottom-left-radius: 8px; border-bottom-right-radius: 8px;  \nborder-width: 4px !important; border-color: #e4e4e4 !important; }\n.selected { border-top-left-radius: 8px; border-top-right-radius: 8px; border-\nwidth: 4px !important; border-color: #e4e4e4 !important; }\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { border-bottom-color: #e4e4e4 !important; }\n#footer { border-width: 2px !important; border-top-left-radius: 8px; border-top-\nright-radius: 8px; border-bottom-left-radius: 8px; border-bottom-right-radius: \n8px; border-left-style: solid !important; border-right-style: solid !important; \nborder-left-color: #e4e4e4 !important; border-right-color: #e4e4e4 !important; \nborder-bottom-color: #e4e4e4 !important; border-top-color: #e4e4e4 !important; \nwidth: 80% !important; margin-left: 230px !important; }\n#footer div img { padding-top: 8px !important; }\n}\n\nScreenie attached.\n   \n", "author": "palhmbs"}, {"message": "Ok, I've done some more work on this.\n\n@-moz-document domain(\"openhatch.org\") {\nbody {\n\tbackground: #f9f9f9 url('<a href=\"http://openhatch.org/static/images/motif-\">http://openhatch.org/static/images/motif-</a>\neee.png') repeat !important; \n        color: black !important;\n \tmargin: 0 !important;\n \tpadding: 0 !important; }\n a { \tcolor: #eb7f04 !important; }\n a.new {   color: #BA0000 !important; }\n.pBody, #content, .ca-nstab-main, .selected { border-width: 2px !important; \nborder-color: #70b347 !important; }\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { border-bottom-color: #70b347 !important; }\n#footer { border-width: 2px !important; border-left-style: solid !important; \nborder-right-style: solid !important; border-left-color: #70b347 !important; \nborder-right-color: #70b347 !important; border-bottom-color: #70b347 !important; \nborder-top-color: #70b347 !important; width: 80% !important; margin-left: 230px !\nimportant; }\n#footer div img { padding-top: 8px !important; }\n}\n\nJessica, I hope you like it - If in-fact you do, then I have attached a patch \nfile for paulproteus to deploy.\n   \n", "author": "palhmbs"}, {"message": "Jessica, can you be the reviewer for this?

Here's my thoughts:\n&gt;\n&gt; I think what we should do is put this in a separate file that lives within\n&gt; the\n&gt; main OpenHatch repository.
