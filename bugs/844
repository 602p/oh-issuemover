It \nlooks like <a href=\"https://www.macports.org/guide/chunked/installing.xcode.html\">https://www.macports.org/guide/chunked/installing.xcode.html</a> is a \nreliable guide for installing XCode, but what do I know.\n\nIf it is a reliable guide, then that seems like a good thing to link to. If you \nhave a better idea, or a video that you can find that you like, link to that.\n\nAnyway, once XCode has been installed, hopefully then typing 'svn help' into a \nTerminal will cause you to see something like:\n\nusage: svn &lt;subcommand&gt; [options] [args]\nSubversion command-line client, version 1.7.13.\nType 'svn help &lt;subcommand&gt;' for help on a specific subcommand.\n\n\n\nrather than \"Command not found\".\n\nIt's important that whoever fixes this actually test that the proposed solution \nseems to work. For example, maybe XCode typically installs svn in a place that \nis not available to Terminal, but if you set the $PATH variable, then it does \nbecome available? You, dear bug fixer, are going to have to find this out.
