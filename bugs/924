I've attached a mockup, and I'm assigning this to \nonceuponatimeforever since she offered to help. :)\n\nThe first major change is that the four boxes no longer include \"attend events\" - instead, that box \nsays \"Get help\". The links in \"Get help\" can go to <a href=\"https://openhatch.org/wiki/Contact\">https://openhatch.org/wiki/Contact</a> . We'll \nprobably want to make a more comprehensive \"get help\" wiki page later, but the contact page \nshould work fine for now.\n\nThe second major change is that there is a set of outreach events links. They should go to these \nplaces:\n\n* Open Source Comes to Campus: <a href=\"http://campus.openhatch.org/\">http://campus.openhatch.org/</a>\n* In-Person Event Handbook: <a href=\"http://opensource-events.com/\">http://opensource-events.com/</a>\n* Outreach events mailing list: <a href=\"http://lists.openhatch.org/mailman/listinfo/events/\">http://lists.openhatch.org/mailman/listinfo/events/</a>\n* Affiliated events: <a href=\"https://openhatch.org/wiki/Events/Affiliated\">https://openhatch.org/wiki/Events/Affiliated</a>\n\nThe third major change is that the tagline on top (next to the baby penguin) is a little smaller, so \nthat all the text fits on two lines.\n\nThis mockup also includes a Twitter widget at the bottom, which I proposed and explained here: \n<a href=\"http://lists.openhatch.org/pipermail/devel/2014-January/003371.html\">http://lists.openhatch.org/pipermail/devel/2014-January/003371.html</a>\n\nThis is definitely not a pixel-perfect mockup - please feel free to make the spacing line up \nproperly instead of being sloppy, and to apply slightly more whitespace where necessary. :)\n\n(I proposed a slightly earlier version of this mockup on the devel list: <a href=\"http://lists.openhatch.org/pipermail/devel/2014-January/003421.html\">http://lists.openhatch.org/pipermail/devel/2014-January/003421.html</a> .)\n   \n", "author": "brittag"}]}
