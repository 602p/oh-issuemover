I have reviewed and deployed your changes. You can see them at \n<a href=\"http://openhatch.org/missions/tar/creating.\">http://openhatch.org/missions/tar/creating.</a>\n\nWe talked about some of this on IRC, but I wanted to outline a couple of things that will make \nworking on future tickets easier:\n\n1. Have a more descriptive commit message. If you update your git checkout, you'll see that I \ntweaked yours a bit. <a href=\"https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/Writing-good-commit-messages\">https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/Writing-good-commit-messages</a> talks \nabout how to write good commit messages.\n\n2. Develop on a branch. This way, when you are working on multiple tickets at once you aren't \nintermingling commits from the two tickets. <a href=\"http://book.git-\">http://book.git-</a>\nscm.com/3_basic_branching_and_merging.html describes how to use git branches.\n\n3. Make each commit a standalone change. In your original commit there were parts of your \nbugimporter changes mixed in with the fix for this ticket.\n\nIf you have questions about any of these topics, I'm happy to talk about them in #openhatch.\n\nThanks again for your patch, and congratulations on your first commit to OpenHatch!\n   \n", "author": "jesstess3"}, {"message": "This is all fixed. :) And an entire week before the end of November.\n   \n", "author": "jillj333"}, {"message": "We should land this during November!\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "This page:\n\n<a href=\"http://openhatch.org/missions/tar/creating\">http://openhatch.org/missions/tar/creating</a>\n\nUses &lt;code&gt; tags around the directory name in the first bullet point, but not on the \nthird.
