Since this is not the case for most people, and\nso that people who are not paulproteus can see the error log for the main site,\nwe need to get these published to the web.\n\nFirst thing that we need to do is get logging configured properly. Since it is\nused sitewide as far as I know, we may as well do this properly. I envisage\n(after a five-minute browse of the Python library page for logging) that we have\nour own custom logging modules that we import e.g. mysite.logging.customs or\nsomething, that handle the different types of logs that we use/need/want over\nthe site. Each of these would handle a particular configuration of the logging\nmodule.\n\nSecond, we need some way of displaying them. There is probably some nice Django\nwizadry that can help here, but not being experienced in Django I will leave\nthis part for someone else to flesh out =)\n\nOf course, most of the above is only really needed if there are multiple\nsections of the site that have logging - if customs is the only log that needs\npublishing it could be much simpler. Since I have only worked so far on the bug\nimporter, I have absolutely no idea what other areas are doing =D Quyite a few\nquestions depend on the scale of logging needed e.g. do we store logs in flat\nfiles or a database, and how far back do we keep logs.\n\n(Nearly all of the above is likely rambling on my part and may or may not read\nwell, since the input box for creating the issue in Roundup is too small for me\nto read my entire message at once; feel free to make suggestions!)\n   \n", "author": "pythonian4000"}]}
