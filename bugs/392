Eventually I realized that the little pencil to the\nleft had a link over it, but it took me a long time, maybe because the pencil\ndidn't look like a link and was outside the \"tell us your name\" box.\n\nCould \"Tell us your name\" itself be a link, or put a link inside the colored box\nwhere that message appears? And if possible, import the full name from Launchpad\nor ask for it in the profile migration screen, so there's no need to ask for it\nas a separate later step?\n   \n", "author": "akkana"}]}
