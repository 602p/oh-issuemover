Here are some things I like about it:\n\n* It would be great if projects created their own such 'paths'\n\n* It turns these individual learning exercises into a curriculum\n\n* It doesn't *require* that project maintainers create the 'paths'\n\nThis is an excellent idea. Thank you!\n\n-- Asheesh.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "Hey!\n\nI love the idea of missions.  I think it's awesome and that great things can be\ndone with it.  Thanks so much for them.\n\nNow, I've been thinking of something that might be added to missions, once we\nhave many missions (I hope that if it's not too hard to create one, lots of\npeople will want to help create more), it might be difficult for a newbie to\nknow where to start.\n\nSo here come the \"paths\".  It's a suggested route that people can take,\naccording to what they want to help with.  It's not compulsory to complete them\nall, nor in order, just a suggested route.\n\nFor example, let's say the \"Path of the translator\", for people who want to\ncontribute gettext translations to a certain project.\n\n1) Basic use of the console\n2) Use of tar\n3) Diff + Patch\n4) Basic Gettext\n\nAt the end of the path, there could be a special \"challenge\" less guided than a\nmission, that involves using the many things involved in the path.\n\nI know this is not a trivial change, I just wanted to contribute ideas that came\nto mind after encountering the awesomeness of missions :)\n   \n", "author": "margamanterola"}]}
