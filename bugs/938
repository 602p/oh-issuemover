Click login/signup on openhatch.org/\n 3. Choose the Google account option\n 4. When asked for permission for Google to provide the email address of the account click cancel \n     (this is where I realized I should sign into my Google account before continuing.)\n\nI'm not sure whether or not this bug is caused by OpenHatch's openid code, or google/openid.\n   \n", "author": "2mas"}]}
