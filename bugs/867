That \nwould be great, I think.\n\nAnother, perhaps even better idea, is to write a python/shell script that \ngenerates the ZIP file, and put that shell script and the resulting ZIP \nfile in a new Github repository owned by openhatch (I'd be happy to give \nyou access to such a repo) and then have the resulting ZIP be a \"release\" \non Github &lt;<a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases\">https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases</a>&gt;\n\nThat way, people can validate that the ZIP file is sane by re-running the \npython/shell script.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "This how I am fixing the bug :\n1.
