Then if you sign up for a site that uses\nGravatar, by putting in your email address you automatically have a profile\npicture on that site.\n\nIf OpenHatch used Gravatar then I think a lot more people would have profile\npictures instead of that little default bird image (cute though it may be, I admit).\n\nI've never used Gravatar, but I imagine it's fairly easy to set up.\n<a href=\"http://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/\">http://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/</a> would be the place to start, it seems.\n   \n", "author": "matrixfrog"}]}
