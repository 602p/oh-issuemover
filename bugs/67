This is useful for users starting new projects (or renaming existing\nones) looking for unique-ish project names.\n\nI don't think this directly ties to the mission, but it's one of those ancillary\nservices that OpenHatch could provide using data that's useful to OpenHatch in\nother ways that would be useful to people (people start new projects all the\ntime) that'd be a good place for ad-based income.\n   \n", "author": "willkahngreene"}]}
