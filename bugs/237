But in Python, it's more idiomatic to not check if it *equals* True,\nbut just to check its boolean truth with \"if\". Furthermore, that syntax isn't\nvalid until Django 1.2, but buildout pulls in Django 1.1.x.\n\nI added a commit on top reverting the invalid template syntax, and I discovered\nthat the dependency checking code was not quite correct. So I wrote a test for\nthat case and fixed it, too.\n\nThis patch kicked things off, and did fix a real problem -- the import.
