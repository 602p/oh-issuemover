The patch looked good, and the test suite passed, so I deploy this to \nthe live site. You can see your changes at: <a href=\"http://openhatch.org/missions/git/diff.\">http://openhatch.org/missions/git/diff.</a>\n\nI did tweak the git commit message, so please run \"git pull\" in your OpenHatch git checkout and \ntake a look at the changes. In particular:\n1. I mentioned what ticket was resolved by this commit.\n2. I formatted the commit message as a short (&lt; 80 character), single-line high level description of \nthe issue, followed by a longer description.\n\nA couple of additional notes:\n\n1. When a ticket you are working on is ready for review, change the Status to \"need-review\" so other \npeople know that they should go review it.\n\n2. It's a good idea to run the test suite locally before submitting a patch. \n<a href=\"https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/blob/master/ADVANCED_INSTALLATION.mkd\">https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/blob/master/ADVANCED_INSTALLATION.mkd</a> has \ninstructions for how to run the test suite.\n\nThanks again for the patch!\n   \n", "author": "jesstess"}, {"message": "Patch created with guidance of the jesstess from IRC.\n   \n", "author": "vlyalcin"}, {"message": "I am taking on that bug.\n   \n", "author": "vlyalcin"}, {"message": "In training mission, in \"Missions: Using Git\" part, in \"Creating a patch\" step,\none of the instruction says '..
