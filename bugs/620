So we need a backups \nstrategy that keeps a second copy of our files there. We can do that with either \none as part of the current backups strategy, where we put things on rsync.net.\n\nI think this is the plan I will implement:\n\n* Move most of inside.openhatch.org into the \"Static website hosting\" system we \nuse now where nearlyfreespeech.net hosts sites for us\n\n* For the big files in inside.openhatch.org, we should move them away from \nlinode.openhatch.org and be sure to have a backup\n\nAnd I won't do it today, so moving out of 0.12.02.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "Bumping to 0.12.01 because it's not the most urgent thing at the moment.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "Well, I asked them, and they didn't say anything.\n\nI'll plan to move these to Rackspace Cloud Files for approximately 84 cents a\nmonth in hosting.
