This means that we get access to the awesome\ncustomization/sorting/grouping of the main issue list, but it also means that\nthe URLs have query variables for EVERYTHING, which makes blog posts look awful.\n\nSo instead, I am creating appropriate templates such that the current milestone\npages are generated when accessing a particular milestone item e.g.\n/bugs/<a href=\"milestone6\">milestone6</a>. This loses the customisability, requiring the template to be\nedited to make changes, but there are really only two views we ever want of a\nmilestone:\n- Showing everything remaining in the milestone, and the progress bar.\n - This will be in the milestone.open.html template, accessible at\n/bugs/milestone#?@template=open\n- Showing all bugs, open or otherwise, in the milestone for use in a blog post etc.\n - This will be in the milestone.item.html template, accessible at /bugs/milestone#\n\nBoth of these views will be hard-coded to sort by activity and group by\npriority, as is the current default case.\n   \n", "author": "pythonian4000"}]}
