It wasn't until I came here to the bug tracker to\nreport not being able to use an arbitrary url to log in and found this issue\nthat I found out how to do so.

On the other hand, even if I had not made that mistake I would\nnot have thought that clicking on OpenId would get me the arbitrary url box.
