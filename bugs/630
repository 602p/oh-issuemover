For example, some people list\n\"Debian\" on their profiles, and others list \"Debian GNU/Linux\".\n\nThis also shows up in bug import: SoaS appears as a string in the Sugar Labs bug\ntracker, and the Sugar Labs bug parser could be responsible for upgrading this\n\"SoaS\" string into \"Sugar on a Stick\" when it downloads bugs from the tracker.\nInstead, it's easier if the bug parser doesn't have to be responsible for that.\n\nSo I think we should have a list somewhere of project names that we\nautomatically expand into their long forms. That list should be somewhere that\n(at least) site admins can edit. Then whenever the backend searches for a\nproject whose name is something on that list.\n\nOne way to do this is to create a ProjectNameAlias model, and have it point with\na ForeignKey at a Project instance. Then the \"edit\" screen within a Project\ncould let anyone edit the aliases for a project.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}]}
