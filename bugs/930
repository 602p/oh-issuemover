Didn't get the response to this. I'm happy to make open hatch a beta tester of this service. \nIt's something I'm actively working on now. I have a proof of concept from the tech side, but there's \nan entire web-ui that's missing and I still need to figure out all of the hosting for the service itself.\n\nIt's coming! I'll assign this issue to myself to indicate this. If that goes against the grain of your \nticketing workflow, please feel free to revert. :)\n   \n", "author": "justinabrahms"}, {"message": "Cool! : D\n\nI don't mean to rush you, but I am curious if you happen to have an \nestimated date you might have a beta test available!
