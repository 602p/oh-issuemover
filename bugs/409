Add it here.\" (or something)\n   \n", "author": "jessica"}, {"message": "I just talked with someone who used the site and ending up on /+projects/.\n\nI just thought about it, and I realized: that page is just useless. Let's ditch\nit until we come up with a good way to have a projects page.\n\nAny objections?\n\nI know it just got a really nice-looking top drawing from aldeka but the page\nwastes users' time. I want to ditch it until we figure out come up with a more\nuseful way to present projects to users.\n\n(Really, we could have a neat tag-based project browser kinda like /search/ ?\nBut some other day.)\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}]}
