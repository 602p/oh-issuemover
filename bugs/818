There were a couple of problems:\n\n1) Once the file is uploaded, the docs say to write in the following command:\ntar zxvf recipes.tar.gz\n\nOn a Mac, this creates an empty directory. This is what actually worked:\n\ntar -xvf recipes.tar.gz\n\n\n2) In the \"High\" hint tab, there needs to be a different command line for mac. 'wget' and 'get' don't \nwork in bash. \n\n-Becka\n   \n", "author": "fstopzero"}]}
