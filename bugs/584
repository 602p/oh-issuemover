Send email reminder to the people who pre-ordered to do this.\n\n* Get shirts from printer in time for PyCon. Distribute shirts there / to bay area people that week; \nmake plan for Boston people and figure out shipping for everybody else after PyCon.\n\nStickers are a thing we ought to have in the future, but I don't really have the energy to get that \ndone before PyCon.
