In order for it to be committed to \nthe repository, you need to change a few things.\n\nHere are the things you need to remove from the patch:\n\n* The patch contains changes to single_file_patch.html  that are \nnot relevant to this particular bug. You should remove them from \nthe patch.\n*  The patch also contains unnecessary changes to many \nexecutable files; you can see this in the patch file with the \n\"old mode\" and \"new mode\" lines.\n\nIn general, it is good to read through the patch before you send \nit. That way, you can see problems like this and correct them \nwithout waiting for someone in the project to find them. It's \nokay that you submitted it in this form, though!\n\nIt looks like you have not yet committed these changes to your \nlocal repository. That means that easy for you to make a commit \nthat selectively contains just the changes you want. I suggest \nyou do that -- \n<a href=\"http://blog.tplus1.com/index.php/2008/10/31/break-up-changes-\">http://blog.tplus1.com/index.php/2008/10/31/break-up-changes-</a>\ninto-different-commits-with-git-add-p/ explains more\n\nIf you do just that, that would be enough and I would commit it. \nIn order to do a great job, here is what you would do on top:\n\n* Change \"Free Open Source Software\" in the &lt;abbr title&gt; to \n\"Free, Libre Open Source Software\"\n* Use git format-patch to make the patch file (See \n<a href=\"https://openhatch.org/wiki/How_we_handle_patches\">https://openhatch.org/wiki/How_we_handle_patches</a> for more info)\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "i have tried changing the code so that it uses only \"FLOSS\".\n   \n", "author": "kabilan"}, {"message": "Also, on a side-note: Did you notice how the gloabal site list styling was \neffecting the widget?\n   \n", "author": "palhmbs"}, {"message": "Seems like both FOSS and FLOSS terms are used on the OpenHatch stuff.\n\nFor example, the widget I have on my web-site uses \"FOSS\" in the title:\n\n   <a href=\"http://bluesock.org/~willg/\">http://bluesock.org/~willg/</a>\n\nAnd this page uses FLOSS at the top if you're not logged in:\n\n   <a href=\"http://openhatch.org/+projects/Miro\">http://openhatch.org/+projects/Miro</a>\n\nThe pedantic side of me thinks OH should standardize on either FLOSS or FOSS.\n\nThis bug covers standardizing on one or the other and fixing the code such that\nit only uses one.\n   \n", "author": "willkahngreene"}]}
