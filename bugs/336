It might have been outmoded; you'll\nhave to look into this. But if you do want to use jQuery tabs, it's\npretty easy to implement. You set up a simple HTML structure (I think\nit's a &lt;ul&gt;), then call a javascript function which turns that\nstructure into tabs. It has lots of features all of which are\noptional. One feature is \"cookie persistence\", i.e., the ability to\nremember what tab you're on even if you leave the page.\n\nI'm pretty sure the homepage used this solution in April 2009. Maybe\nsearch the logs for variants of the strings \"tabs\" or \"jquery tabs\".\n\nHappy hacking!\n\nRaffi\n\n2011/3/31 Asheesh Laroia &lt;<a href=\"mailto:bugs@openhatch.org\">bugs@openhatch.org</a>&gt;:\n&gt;\n&gt; Asheesh Laroia &lt;<a href=\"mailto:asheesh@asheesh.org\">asheesh@asheesh.org</a>&gt; added the comment:\n&gt;\n&gt; Something I think we've done in the past is make clicking each link adjust the\n&gt; \"fragment\" (the stuff after # in <a href=\"http://openhatch.org/#fragment\">http://openhatch.org/#fragment</a> ), and then when\n&gt; you hit \"Forward\" and \"Back\", the page checks which \"fragment\" is active and\n&gt; shows that tab.
