The \"hints\"\non the other hand, are so straight forward that they don't allow much thought\nand processing, they just have to type a command and see what it does.\n\nFrom my point of view, it'd be better to allow another level of hints, with a\ncouple of links to follow, or suggested google searches that will turn up the\ncorrect results.\n\nAnother possibility would be to include this information as an additional page,\nas already suggested in <a href=\"http://openhatch.org/bugs/issue535,\">http://openhatch.org/bugs/issue535,</a> however, I do think\nthat it is educational for people to have to find the info and process it by\nthemselves, just that maybe they need a bit more orientation about how to find it.\n\nPS: Thanks for such an awesome idea turned into reality!\n   \n", "author": "margamanterola"}]}
