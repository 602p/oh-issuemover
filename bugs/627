For those Trac instances, which run a relatively\nold version of the Trac software, we have to go crawling a bug's RSS feed from\nthe tracker to get hints about when it was created, etc.\n\nIt would be better if the TracTrackerModel contained no old_trac field, and\ninstead we inferred at crawl time if a Trac instance is \"old\"-style.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}]}
