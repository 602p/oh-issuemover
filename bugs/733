Are any metrics\nbeing kept of this nature?\n\nFunding can be found more easily if you can count how many people you are\nhelping. Eleanor A. Smith gave a class at foundationcenter.org/sanfrancisco on\nthis topic. Listing each activity you make, inputs, outputs and tools/methods\nused for data collection in the form of a \"logic model\" will help your program\nbe able to link intended SMART short term and long term outcomes.  SMART =\nspecific, meaningful, attainable, relevant and time limited.\n   \n", "author": "grantbow"}]}
