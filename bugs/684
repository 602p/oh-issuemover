Edit \nmysite/profile/templates/profile/main.html , make a local commit, and submit a \npull request.\n\nIf you do this, you'll be fixing a bug that has been open for more than a year, \nwhich would be grand.\n\n(Also: I'm marking this as bitesize, and would prefer that a new contributor to \nthe project be the one to fix it.)\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "I can't find any pink links.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "Marking as 'later' for now.
