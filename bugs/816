It doesn't load for me.\n\nMoreover we should use url() with absolute URLs; we should use e.g. \nurl('/static/images/cross.gif') -- and we should move those image references \ninto the corresponding CSS files, and use a HTML class on the attribute to pick \nup the styling from the CSS.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}]}
