With the mockup as it stands, perhaps what we\ncan do is when you arrive at /search/ with no search, you see a few different\nboxes like:\n\n* Want to search for something to do in open source?\n\n* Don't even have the foggiest idea how this all works?\n\n* Want to add your own project to our index?\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "See (terrible webcam scan of) mockup.\n\nRight now, we've killed /projects/, which means there's basically no way to \neasily get to our project pages. (Which is kind of good, since they're broken \nright now... that's a separate bug!)\n\nTo fix that, here's a redesign of the /search/ page to make it easy to find both \nbugs and projects through the same interface.\n\nNotes from the mockup:\n\nOn the left is the filtering UI. Searches become filters (which can be removed, \nlike other filters, by clicking the 'X'). Eventually (not part of this bug), \nthere will be a 'curated bugs' category chosen through the project page \ninterface and a curated-bugs-only filter will be on by default when the page \nloads.\n\nBelow, filters for language (limited to 3 or so, with more link) and tags \n(similarly expandable). \"Bitesize\" should be renamed to \"easy\" or \"beginner\".\n\nBelow that, you can choose to only show projects, only show (projects with) \nbugs, or to show everything.\n\nBelow the filtering interface, a second left-column module states the number of \ntracked projects, a link to add a project (create a project page), link to add a \nbug tracker (to wiki docs), and 'About this feature' (which goes to the blog \npost linked to by the current /search/ interface).\n\nAt the top of the right column, there's a little banner for first-time \ncontributors, with a link to a wiki page with some helpful advice. It can be \nX'ed out and disappeared.\n\nOn the right column, you have modules for each project with their logo and \nmentors (if any). The project logo and name link to the project page; the \nmentors thing links to the mentors tab/area on their project page.\n\nIf a matching project has bugs that we know about and match the query, $MIN \nnumber of bugs appear below it (probably 2, maybe as many as 3). There's a 'more \nbugs' link that will expand downward and show more matching bugs; in the absence \nof js, it links to some obscure part of the project page with a full listing of \nall the project's scraped/known bugs. Hovering over the bug changes its \nbackground color; clicking a bug expands it to include more information (as \nnow).\n\nProjects can appear even without bugs or mentors, if our data on the project \n(e.g. language) matches the query.\n\nOrdering of bugs within a project: first curated bugs, then bugs with the most \nrecent activity.\n\nOrdering of projects: favor projects that have curated bugs, projects with \nanswered Q&amp;As, and projects with mentors. Otherwise by similarity of project \nand/or its bugs to search query/filters.\n   \n", "author": "aldeka"}]}
