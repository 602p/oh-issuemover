Asheesh assured me that that if I followed the instructions, all would be okay. Sure enough, \nthe syncdb command didn't complain about Django missing as I had expected. \n\nIf we are going to bundle the dependencies with the repo, we should explain to users that in 95% of \nDjango projects, this is not the case. They will need to run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install \nall of the project's dependencies.\n\nI'm not proposing to change the way things are currently done, because I think it's of great \nconvenience (albeit an annoyance to maintain) a directory of bundled dependencies, but I do think \nwe should add something in the documentation giving the reader a heads up that this is not typical, \nand if they try to skip the pip install step with other Django projects, things won't work.\n   \n", "author": "natea"}]}
