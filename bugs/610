Let's\nstop doing that.\n\nI propose we follow what Kitsune does:\n<a href=\"http://kitsune.readthedocs.org/en/latest/vendor.html\">http://kitsune.readthedocs.org/en/latest/vendor.html</a>\n\nHere is a summary:\n\n* We create a vendor/ directory in our main source tree\n* Any time we add a pure-Python dependency, we use pip to download it and jam\ninto into vendor/\n\nHere's why this is awesome:\n\n* It is super easy for anyone, even without \"git push\" access, to add new\ndependencies.\n* It downloads at the same time as our main git repo, so you are sure to have\nall the dependencies.\n* We no longer require any other websites to be online (e.g. PyPI,\nlinode.openhatch.org, etc.) to be online while you are setting up a dev environment.\n\n\"Pure-Python\" refers to dependencies of ours that do not require C code.\n\nI considered using a git-submodule for the vendor/ directory, and I tried it. It\nhas the downside of being hard to upgrade dependencies if you do not have \"git\npush\" access. Also, in general, git-submodule has just depressingly bad UI and\nno one should be forced to use it.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}]}
