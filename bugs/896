This would \ninclude:\n\n- The readthedocs index page (<a href=\"http://openhatch.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html\">http://openhatch.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html</a>): Should be more verbose \n(at least full sentences!) and highlight the most common/important part of the \ndocumentation.  Make sure to include a section on \"how to navigate this \ndocumentation\".  Should link to any key non-documentation aspects of OH.\n\n- Make sure the README in oh-mainline main directory \n(<a href=\"https://github.com/openhatch/oh-\">https://github.com/openhatch/oh-</a>\nmainline/blob/e485c8d98d5b7386ecf436526305e930ac25e4ad/README.rst) and the \nREADME in the docs directory (<a href=\"https://github.com/openhatch/oh-\">https://github.com/openhatch/oh-</a>\nmainline/blob/e485c8d98d5b7386ecf436526305e930ac25e4ad/docs/README.rst) are \nintelligible and link to the readthedocs landing page directly. \n\nFor all of the above, make sure all links go where intended.
