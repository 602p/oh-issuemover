I think these bugs are almost always past the \npoint where new contributors can help. (Generally reviewing needs to be done by \nseasoned developers.)\n\nProject page with count of volunteer opportunities:\n\n<a href=\"https://openhatch.org/+projects/OpenHatch\">https://openhatch.org/+projects/OpenHatch</a>   (last box in the right column)\n\nVolunteer Opportunities page showing (currently) lots of bugs that have \"needs-\nreview\" status:\n\n<a href=\"https://openhatch.org/search/?project=OpenHatch\">https://openhatch.org/search/?project=OpenHatch</a>\n\n\nMy user story: I was curious if there was a bite-sized bug for OpenHatch that I \nmight be interested in tackling, so I found the openhatch project page, and after \nsome hunting around, found the volunteer opportunities link. Then at the volunteer \nopportunities page I read the headlines, clicked a couple to see more, and then \nclicked through to read one bug. After reading about a page worth of posts on the \nbug, I realized that somebody fixed it already, and it was just awaiting review. \nOops... wasted some time there. Then I went back to the volunteer opportunities \nlist, and clicked all of them to see their statuses (thankfully they show on this \npage) and found a couple bugs that hadn't gotten to the review phase yet. Not a \nhuge waste of time, but it cut into my attention span quite a bit.\n\nThank you.\n\n            - Jason\n\nP.S. is this a bite-sized bug?\n   \n", "author": "JasonWoof"}]}
