You can see a demo of that sort of thing here: \n<a href=\"http://flowplayer.org/tools/overlay/index.html\">http://flowplayer.org/tools/overlay/index.html</a>\n\nIf you happen to like JavaScript, this actually be pretty easy. You'll\nhave to remove some \"chrome\" (site layout), which will require a little \ntemplate wrangling. That part gets less bitesized, and involves some CSS \nwork.\n\nThis is pretty well-defined and would make a good first bug for someone with \nJavaScript skills and a Django template background. We would totally help \nyou if you want help.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}]}
