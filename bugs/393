When I\ncopied the production database locally, I ran into \"NoneType has no\nattribute...\" errors when I tried to delete them, so they may require database\nintervention. And at the same time, I think we can clear out the reversion\ndatabase; it isn't used anywhere except in /customs/, and hasn't been used at\nall there anyway, so it's just been sitting there filling up with rubbish as we\nmessed around with the tracker models.\n   \n", "author": "pythonian4000"}]}
