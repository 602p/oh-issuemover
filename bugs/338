So there isn't an SSH account for Mailman right now, but I can work on\ngiving you access.\n\nThe easy way that I was originally thinking was to modify the Mailman signup\npage's HTML -- just remove the comment form stuff, and/or add custom CSS to hide\nit from the user. Then we don't prompt them for a password.\n\nMailman will email them a password for mailman, and that's that.\n\nWe could also Django-auth-ify it.
