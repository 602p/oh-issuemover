It would be reasonably bitesized to do it, too.\n\nThank you for it! I think you'll see this implemented shortly.\n\n(Curious: are you interested in helping out? If so, I'm quite happy to set aside time to mentor you on IRC and/or screen-share to pair program. The pair programming idea comes highly recommended from another project, and I think we can go from this bug report to fix deployed in 2 hours, with you in the driver's seat.)\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "When I go to the bottom of a project, I see that it says, \"No one on OpenHatch\nhas signed up as a mentor for Linux Kernel 2.6. Can you? Add the tag.\"\n\nWhen I click add the tag, it just takes me to my profile editor.  I'm not sure\nwhat format the tag should be in.  The exact name of the project?\n\nIt would be much better if the link automatically added the proper tag to your\nprofile for you.\n   \n", "author": "sarahsharp"}]}
