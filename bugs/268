(well, everybody on the OpenHatch bug tracker ^_^ )\n\nWe are currently in the middle of setting up a fancy new central login system so\nthat you only need to login once to access the main site, wiki and bug tracker;\nthis bug is purely about making sure that you all know what is happening. The\ncentral login system being developed keeps track of a single person across the\nmultiple authentication systems via their username, and if anyone's usernames in\nthe different databases are different at time of switch-on, they will lose\naccess to those accounts and new ones with the same username as the main site\nwill be created, resulting in loss of user-bug information etc.\n\nSo we would like to ask everyone to ensure that their Roundup login name is the\nsame as their main OpenHatch username. This should only take about a minute of\nyour time, and will greatly help us make smooth transition to the unified login\nsystem. If you find that your Roundup login name needs changing, simply follow\nthe link in the banner or the bottom of the sidebar to your details page to do\nso. (And if you can't remember your OpenHatch username,\n<a href=\"http://openhatch.org/account/login/\">http://openhatch.org/account/login/</a> can help you with that =D )\n\nCheers,\nJack Grigg\n   \n", "author": "pythonian4000"}]}
