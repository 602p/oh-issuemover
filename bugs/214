Even if I update a file, I don't want to have to bother updating the \n&gt; copyright year in the header at the top of the file. Is that okay?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. I want the licensing header at the top of the file to say:\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Copyright contributing authors to OpenHatch. See AUTHORS file for a list\"\n&gt; \n&gt; Is that okay?\n\nHi Asheesh,\n\nAs with so many things, the answer to this question is \"Yes, but.\"  In\nboth of these cases, doing what you describe will not compromise\nownership of the copyright, or your users' ability to exercise the\nrights that they're supposed to receive under AGPLv3.  You can still be\na successful free software project if you do this.\n\nHowever, doing these things may cause you some trouble down the line. \nIf you have less accurate information in your copyright line, it may be\nmore difficult to prove willful infringement in court, if you ever need\nto pursue a violation.  If the need ever arises to contact contributors\nto a particular file (it happens from time to time), having the level of\nindirection in AUTHORS will make that job harder.  If people want to use\njust a little bit of your code in their own projects, they'll probably\neither have to make sure they copy the contents of the AUTHORS file as\nwell, or manually add that information to the files in question: keeping\nthe information directly in the file will make things easier for them.\n\nIf you want to have a super-detailed conversation about these sorts of\ntrade-offs, that's probably a talk you'd have to have with a lawyer. \nPersonally, I think the added hassle of keeping clear information\ndirectly in the files pays off in the long run.  But ultimately the\nchoice is yours.\n\n&gt; 3. To demonstrate that people are submitting their own work, we ask them \n&gt; to send a note to our publicly-archived mailing list.

If you're willing, it'd be nice if you say 'the \n&gt; Affero GPL, version 3 or later, at your option'.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is that okay?\n\nYes, that suffices to ensure that you can distribute the work under\nAGPLv3 (with the or-later clause if they provide that).\n\n&gt; 4.
