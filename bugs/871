Your best bet for \nunderstanding how to make this change is to start by reading the existing code \nwithin <a href=\"https://github.com/openhatch/oh-bugimporters\">https://github.com/openhatch/oh-bugimporters</a> that makes the Google Code \nimporter work.\n\nIf you choose to do this, make sure to claim this bug by marking it as \"Assigned \nTo\" yourself.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}]}
