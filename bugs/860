I just took a look at this now.\n\nI'm impressed that you found this trivial issue lurking deep inside a hard-coded \nlist of options in the OpenHatch codebase.\n\nOne day we should look at refactoring this to avoid bugs like this. For now, I \nam simply thrilled to deploy it. So...\n\nI've done that!\n\nIf you're willing to follow the \"Permit us to share your work\" section here\n<a href=\"http://openhatch.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributor/handling_patches.html#per\">http://openhatch.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributor/handling_patches.html#per</a>\nmit-us-to-share-your-work\nthat'd be lovely, too.\n\nThanks for this!

I can't check the project settings to see what the Bug Trackers tab\nreads though, as I get an error 500 at the moment when trying to edit the\nproject :') However I am happy that this issue is resolved.\n\nAs for adding \"Launchpad\" to the \"Bug Tracker\" tab, it doesn't look very\ncomplicated to do so, therefore I shall try and use this as an opportunity to\nmake a first contribution to OpenHatch.\n   \n", "author": "jpichon"}, {"message": "I first apologise for not doing things in the right order, though eventually I\nwould have hit the same issue:\n\n1.

I then created \"OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon)\" in the Projects in my profile\n\nI now would like to link the project to the tracker I previously created.\n\nIf I go to <a href=\"http://openhatch.org/+projects/OpenStack%20dashboard%20%28Horizon%29,\">http://openhatch.org/+projects/OpenStack%20dashboard%20%28Horizon%29,</a>\nand click on \"No volunteer opportunities in OpenStack dashboard (Horizon)\nindexed here yet.
