(DB \nsettings, etc). The production server can also have a local_settings.py with its local settings.\n\nThis keeps it simple, and doesn't risk the chance for confusion.\n   \n", "author": "jslootbeek"}, {"message": "Right now, we keep the Django site settings in mysite/settings.py . There is no\nsupported way to override those changes, so developers end up making changes to\nthat file and then have unstaged local changes.\n\nI suggest the following:\n\nsettings.py: This file should mostly just import the OpenHatch default settings.\nIt should be in git, but also in .gitignore so that changes a user makes here\nare not committed\n\nopenhatch/default_settings.py: This file should contain the defaults and be\nstored in version control\n\nAs for the production_settings.py file, that can stay, and the deployment can\nhave a settings.py that imports from there.\n\nI hope we can nail this down by the end of the weekend. If anyone with some\ngit+Django savvy wants to give this a shot, feel free to assign it to yourself!\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}]}
