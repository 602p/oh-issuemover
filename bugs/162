However, once the user logs in to \nOH, they cannot return to that useful landing page anymore unless they log out again, which \nmakes the site a bit more confusing and difficult to navigate while logged in.\n\nI propose that the initial landing page should have a different URL from the user's \"home\" page \nwhen logged in, and you should be able to access the initial landing page while logged in. \nPerhaps \"home\" should give the user their personal homepage, while clicking the OpenHatch logo \ntakes them to the landing page.\n   \n", "author": "nelson"}, {"message": "Think I've got it fixed, it was only a matter of putting the if statements with the \nform code in the right places. - Hopefully I haven't wrecked the formatting.\n   \n", "author": "nelson"}]}
