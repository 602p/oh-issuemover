Including deleting their user page &amp; user talk page on the wiki, and maybe removing their \nusername from wiki talk pages where they signed their name (if any)?\n   \n", "author": "brittag"}, {"message": "I think this should work something like email confirmation works generally, \nwhere you get sent an email to confirm your deletion, and then we delete you.\n\nNote that in theory this is tricky; when the main OH user goes away, should the \nRoundup user and wiki users get deleted as well?\n\nWe should decide that.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}]}
