Perhaps we could just ping via the site? I could send him a message \non the site and it would just be there. I could show my email address (or not). \n\nOtherwise, people wanting to help might sit there waiting for step #2? \n\nStep #1: Click button saying you want to help\nStep #2: Get contacted and eased in with \"Hello.
