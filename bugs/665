Instead, the\nvalidation of the diff should be done during form validation.\n\nmysite.missions.svn.checkout_submit has a similar problem: it tests if the\ncleaned_data secret word is the secret word that we asked for; however, this\nshould be done during form validation.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}]}
