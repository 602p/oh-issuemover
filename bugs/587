Michael points out that makes it hard for people to drive by, help\nout an open source project find a new contributor, and wander off.\n\nHe also points out that this job is similar to what you do when hanging out in\nan IRC channel for a project, so a similar level of authentication is reasonable.\n\nThis ticket covers the following changes in addition to <a href=\"issue282\">issue282</a> :\n\nThe conversation initiated by a user clicking the \"I want to help\" button is one\nthat all visitors to the site should be able to help resolve. Given that:\n\n* If you aren't logged in, you can use the full UI, but when you make a change\nin it, we show you a modal dialog that says, e.g., \"Thanks for helping $NAME\nfind something to do in $PROJECT. Can you give us a name to leave on this page\nso that the project maintainer knows who got in touch with the wannahelper?\"\n\n* If you are logged in, you can use the full UI, even if you're not a project\nmaintainer. (Maybe we should give you a modal dialog box thanking you, and then\nask if you want to receive \"Maintainer updates\" (AKA wannahelper mail) in the\nfuture. Maybe we should also suggest that you add yourself as a contributor to\nthe project, now that you have contributed in some way!)\n\nThese are suggestions. I'm open to other thoughts! Again, these aren't\nshowstoppers for <a href=\"issue282\">issue282</a> , so that can continue, but suggested further additions.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}]}
