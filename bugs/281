Some detailed feedback:\n\nktarnowski, do you want to take a look in terms of spacing?\n\nRe-organizing the page this way exposes some of the problems with the site.\nMaybe we can focus next month on \"performance and basic improvements\"...? Who knows.\n\nSome things that came to mind:\n\n* You point to the somewhat useless /+projects/ page. I guess that's the best\nplace to point, but maaan, that sure exposes the flaws with that page. You\nshould keep it that way, and we should fix /+projects/. (I kind of wonder if you\nshould link to a sample project page instead... but which one? Probably not\nOpenHatch because that would be confusing.)\n\nOn the \"Attract contributors...\" side, I would suggest adding a box labeled:\n\"Create a profile to talk about your involvement\" and linking somewhere. Where\nto link? If you want to link to a sample profile, someone like willkg's profile\nwould be good.\n\nThere's some sense in which the text could use some sprucing up to really\nsuggest activity. Maybe linking to examples would help with that, but I don't\nwant to clutter everything up.\n\nI wish that \"Tell people who have clicked your project's 'I want to help' button\nhow they can contribute\" could link to the projects that the person actually\nworks on. But I guess the user is not logged in yet.\n\nYou wrote \"volunteer opportunities finder\" but in e.g.\n<a href=\"https://openhatch.org/about/\">https://openhatch.org/about/</a> we call it \"volunteer opportunity finder\".\n\nIt looks really really good, as per the mockup.

In particular between top navigation bar and OH tagline, OH \ntagline and tab widget, tab caption and its contents.\n\n* [ALL] I think that the tabbed widget would look better with small border/rim \naround it, like 'Recent activity' or 'OpenHatch news' boxes. Right now it\ns too bright.\n\n* [ALL] Additionally to the above, adding small border/rim around the active tab \nitself might look really nice. Applying rounded corners might help as well.\n\n* [MOCKUP-3] Adding some padding (yo!) between section header and border-bottom \nmight look better. Try changing the color of the border-bottom to something from \n#888 - #eee.\n\n* [MOCKUP-3] Recommended people section. Try to organize entries as follows:\n  \n         Width: ~50%   Some padding (&gt;20px?)             The rest\n              |              |               /--------------/\n  /-----------------------\\/---\\/-----------------------\\\n  [Avatar] [Name] [Surname]     [Projects]\n           [Nickname]           [Tags]\n           [City]\n           [Country]\n\nIn general, I like the way in which the design is heading.

Maybe call that heading \"Make a\ncontribution to open source\".\n\nI think that \"Attract contributors to your project\" feels pretty fleshed-out, too.\n\nI would be okay with skipping the \"Help out\" section for now, since it's kind of\nweak. That's what I mean by iterating -- one day, maybe we'll have features that\nmake sense to fill up a section.
