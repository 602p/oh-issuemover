I'm hereby\ncodifying the idea.\n\nAn OpenHatch group would be a group of people who meet at some periodic basis to\nhang out and work on OpenHatch-related things.  The group could be location\nbased (OpenHatch Philly, OpenHatch Chelmsford, OpenHatch Internet, ...) or it\ncould be topic based (OpenHatch Python [for python-related projects], OpenHatch\nDocs, OpenHatch Database Sanity, ...), or some other slicing (OpenHatch Things\nWe Can Do In Emacs, OpenHatch Free Software, OpenHatch GNU, ...).  Or something\nlike that--I don't think anyone's mentioned a requirement for structure or anything.\n\nWhat would be needed from the OpenHatch site to make this work better would be:\n\n1. a page on the OpenHatch site listing all the registered OpenHatch groups and\nfor each group, some details on how they coordinate themselves (meetup url, wiki\nurl, mailing list url, irc address, ...), description, ...\n\n2. a launch page that talks about the existence of OpenHatch groups, what they\nare, how to start your own and links to the groups listing page.\n\n3. (optional) a way to indicate which OpenHatch groups you belong to on your\nprofile -- This isn't necessary, but it might be neat.\n\n4. (optional) a calendar listing upcoming events -- I'm not sure how to do this\none without creating a lot of maintenance work for someone.\n\n\nThe goal here is not to build the infrastructure required to organize and run an\nOpenHatch group (wikis, mailing lists, scheduling things, ...) but rather to\ncodify the existence of groups, provide a directory/listing of groups and how to\nget involved, and provide some documentation on how to create your own and what\nsorts of things work and what don't.\n   \n", "author": "willkahngreene"}]}
