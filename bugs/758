I assume the labels should be on the left because (1) it's the usual way \nand (2) the labels end with a semicolon, which would be the case if there was \nsomething after it.\n\nIf you look at the source for the email field:\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=\"id_email\"&gt;Email:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"email\" \nid=\"id_email\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\nthe label comes before the input, and both the label and the input are wrapped \ninside a p tag. All the other fields are built the same way. I suppose there's \nsomething fishy going on with the CSS, somehow the text, password and file \ninputs and textarea get a \"float: left;\" property. When deactivating it with \nFirebug (and there are a few of those to deactivate) the fields are displayed \nproperly.\n   \n", "author": "e2jk"}]}
