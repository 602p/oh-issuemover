Thank you for looking into this bug. You chose to use\n'linebreaks' rather than 'linebreaksbr'. Elsewhere we use 'linebreaksbr' but\nactually I like your way better. For that reason I've switched our other uses to\nthe 'linebreaks' filter.\n\n* When applying 0002, git gives me an error about \"whitespace errors\". Some of\nyour lines end in a space character. Nerdy people all over the Internet seem to\ndislike this, but I don't really understand why. I'm glad that you fixed them in\n0003. I fixed a few more that were lingering in comments.\n\nSo -- cleanup patches are welcome. There isn't a code style document. I haven't\ngiven code style a great deal of explicit thought; the nicest thing would be if\nwe can just adopt someone else's code style document (-:\n\n---\n\nAs for the test failures... yes, um, eeek. Those are known issues in the sense\nthat I know about them, but we should really fix those failing tests, as they're\ndecreasing the usefulness of the test suite!\n\n--\n\nI'm marking this as resolved -- I just checked Will's profile, and it does the\nspacing properly!\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "I've attached a patch addressing the missing paragraph breaks, plus a test. Two\nother commits clean up unused imports and variables and remove trailing\nwhitespace. (paulproteus: if you'd prefer that I not do this cosmetic clean-up,\nor if I'm not keeping with style guidelines OpenHatch has, please let me know --\nI didn't see a style document on the wiki)\n\nAs an aside, after following the README instructions I seem to have an\nenvironment in which many tests fail. I've attached the output from\ntest_sans_customs and the search tests as examples, in case that's useful. I did\nverify that no new tests failed after adding these commits.\n   \n", "author": "jesstess"}, {"message": "I just created a new answer on the Miro project page here:\n\n   <a href=\"http://openhatch.org/+projects/Miro\">http://openhatch.org/+projects/Miro</a>\n\nThe answer was this:\n\n\"\"\"\nMiro is built by a community of people doing a variety of activities: using\nMiro, bug triage, testing, translating, documenting and development.\n\n\nFirst thing to do is read through this page to see whether we have needs that\nmatch your skills and inclinations.\n\nSecond thing to do is to reach out and say hi.
