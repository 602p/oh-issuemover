Fixing it came down to adding adequate form\nobject to data dictionary passed to Django template, like this.\n\nChanges to mission templates are meant to align Submit button with file inputs.\n\nThe import and True check you have mentioned are necessary for SVN\nmission to work. The import statement deals with unsatisfied import in\ncode responsible for checking whether user completed prerequisites for\ngiven mission step. As for the True check, it fixes a bug where no\ninformation is presented to the user, regardless of SVN mission step\nchosen.\n\nNext time I will break down patch files into smaller chunks. Can we\nstick to one patch file in this case only?\n\nOn 28 January 2011 17:27, Asheesh Laroia &lt;<a href=\"mailto:bugs@openhatch.org\">bugs@openhatch.org</a>&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Asheesh Laroia &lt;<a href=\"mailto:asheesh@asheesh.org\">asheesh@asheesh.org</a>&gt; added the comment:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Chris,\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a fairly big commit.
