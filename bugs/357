I renamed the page to\n\"Privacy policy\".\n\n* The pages you copy-pasted seem to have weird \"?\" characters in them; for\nexample: \"To make sure you are using OpenHatch via SSL, look for ?https? in your\nweb browser?s address bar.\" Can you go through them and fix that?\n\n* You have a section heading with no title on the privacy policy page: Look for\n\"==\" in bold on <a href=\"http://openhatch.org/wiki/Privacy_policy\">http://openhatch.org/wiki/Privacy_policy</a> to find that. Can you\nclean that up?\n\n* Sometimes you capitalize \"OpenHatch\" weirdly. It should be either \"openhatch\"\nif it's in a URL, or \"OpenHatch\" normally. There's one instance of \"openHatch\",\nwhich should become OpenHatch.\n\nAll in all, thank you for this. It'll be great to stop having these pages be\nhosted on the blog.\n\nOnce those issues are corrected, I will set up the redirects, and mark this as\nresolved!\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "Pages are moved, just need to redirect all old links to the wiki pages...\n\n<a href=\"http://openhatch.org/wiki/Contact\">http://openhatch.org/wiki/Contact</a>\n<a href=\"http://openhatch.org/wiki/Privacy-Policy\">http://openhatch.org/wiki/Privacy-Policy</a>\n&amp; make colophon redirect to <a href=\"http://openhatch.org/wiki/About_OpenHatch\">http://openhatch.org/wiki/About_OpenHatch</a>\n   \n", "author": "palhmbs"}, {"message": "Since <a href=\"issue337\">issue337</a> is closed, I figured this would be a better issue to use to track \nthese changes.\n\nSo Asheesh recommends we move: \n<a href=\"https://openhatch.org/policies-etc/\">https://openhatch.org/policies-etc/</a>\n<a href=\"https://openhatch.org/contact/\">https://openhatch.org/contact/</a> \nAnd make <a href=\"https://openhatch.org/colophon/\">https://openhatch.org/colophon/</a> redirect to /about/ \nAlso, that we should revisit the wiki's sidebar, too.\n\nLet's get this all tidied up before the end this milestone!!\n   \n", "author": "palhmbs"}, {"message": "We have started on this, see <a href=\"issue337\">issue337</a>.\n   \n", "author": "palhmbs"}, {"message": "Don't forget to make sure all the urls forward!\n\nDependent on <a href=\"issue356\">issue356</a>.\n   \n", "author": "aldeka"}]}
