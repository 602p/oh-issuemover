However, I'm opposed to using \nGithub's issue-tracking software (as opposed to either this Roundup install, or \neven a hosted free software tracker).\n\nGithub in general is not free software. I don't mind this for version control, \nsince git is free and decentralized. If we ever want to leave Github in the \nfuture, doing so is extremely easy. I don't want to get locked into using Github, \nand using their special add-ons, including issue tracking, would increase our \nswitching costs significantly.\n   \n", "author": "aldeka"}, {"message": "Thanks for filing this!
