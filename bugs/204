That's okay, though. I'll rename the ticket.\n\n* There's some PEP8 style violations. In particular, function(key=value) should\nnot be function(key = value). This occurs a few times. Someone else is going to\ncome by and fix this if you don't.\n\n* addStep() has a \"pdb\" in it. Nothing seems to call that, so I'll let that slide.\n\n* The images in mysite/static/images/buildhelper/ are (I'm presuming) the same\nas on this bug, and your original work. If that's false, let me know!\n\nI'll push this!
