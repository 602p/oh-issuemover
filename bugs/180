So future development used \"user\".\n\nWe never got around to fixing up all the templates, so some  still sometimes\nrefer to the_user. This is confusing!\n\nSo we should we scrub out all mentions of \"the_user\" from the OpenHatch\ntemplates, and make sure the pages still work.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}]}
