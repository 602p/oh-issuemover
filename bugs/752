In particular, the footer at the bottom isn't in sync \nwith the main site's footer. It'd be great if the blog theme were in sync with \nthe main site theme.\n\nAdditionally, the WordPress theme has other problems:\n\n* It's not available in public version control.\n* We don't document how to change it.\n\nMy current plan for how to change it involves writing a tool to convert our \nDjango theme into a WordPress theme. In particular:\n\n* First, I will add a Django view that generates a stub page with a few fill-in-\nthe-blank pieces.\n\n* Then, I will write a little tool that converts these stub pages into a \nWordPress-compatible theme directory.\n\n* Then, I will document the process for modifying our WordPress theme.\n\n* Then I will request review on all that. I will update this ticket as this plan \nprogresses, and feedback here is extremely welcome!\n\n(I realize the importance of this may be low -- hence priority == wish -- but I \nthink it's fun, and it's Sunday, and it will have the advantage of making it \neasier to test style updates against the blog. We've had a long-standing problem \nof CSS changes sometimes breaking the blog view, and we care a lot about the blog \nlooking reasonable.)\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}]}
