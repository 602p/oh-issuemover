(Could also\nbe for general mission-related questions etc?)\n\nMission step ideas:\n- Log in!\n- Announce your presence on the channel?\n- Direct in-channel message at someone by including their username in the message?\n- Perform an action?\n- PM a \"user\" (bot) with a secret codeword?\n- Register your nick with ChanServ? (How would this integrate?)\n- What else do people do on IRC?\n   \n", "author": "pythonian4000"}]}
