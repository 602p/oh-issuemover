I was wondering whether OpenHatch can be\nused as an instrument in helping prospective authors in finding similar projects\nto fork/join rather than start anew and reinventing the wheel whenever there are\nany.\n\nThis can done by providing a forum-like infrastructure for developers to put up\na project idea for the community to see. The community could then provide\nsuggestions to the author that would do one of\n(a) help improve and fine-tune the author's blueprint if it appears original\n(b) tell the author about a similar project if there is one\n(c) tell the author it's not worth it if it isn't (which coder hasn't written a\nproject that later turns out to be useless?)\n\nIt would also serve as a advertisement to invite developers to help out if\nsomeone has a unique/great idea.\n   \n", "author": "umang"}]}
