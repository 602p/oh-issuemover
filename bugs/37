Most FLOSS projects are not racially\ndiverse or gender-balanced: they're heavily white, with Asians and\nBrazilians as the runners-up, and are at most 5% female. Given the graphic's\nsample size of four, including an Asian woman when neither of those\nattributes approach even close to 25% of the FLOSS community was already\nkinda tokenism. Unless we add (lots) more characters to the graphic, adding\nother minorities would be token, too.\n\nOf course, no one except me seems to think she's Asian. Do people just by\ndefault read Asian characters as white unless they have buck teeth and\nslanted lines for eyes? I could (in theory) redraw her that way! Then\npeople'd really get it...and be (rightly) pissed off for a different reason.\n:P\n\nSo my questions:\n\nWhat, exactly, do you think changing one of the OpenHatch doodles' virtual\nmelanin level from #fbe4d0 to #8e682d will accomplish?\n\nAre we trying to represent (with a little wiggle room for aesthetic\npurposes) the FLOSS community as it is, or the FLOSS community as we wish it\nwas?\n\nIf the latter, what on earth is the gender, age, weight, race, and\ncoloration distribution of the \"ideal\" FLOSS community that I should be\ntaking cues from?\n\n-- Karen\n\nOn Mon, Mar 15, 2010 at 7:01 AM, Asheesh Laroia &lt;<a href=\"mailto:bugs@openhatch.org\">bugs@openhatch.org</a>&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Asheesh Laroia &lt;<a href=\"mailto:asheesh@openhatch.org\">asheesh@openhatch.org</a>&gt; added the comment:\n&gt;\n&gt; (Adding Parker and Raffi in case you have thoughts.)\n&gt;\n&gt; ----------\n&gt; nosy: +gameguy43, rafpaf\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________\n&gt; Roundup issue tracker &lt;<a href=\"mailto:bugs@openhatch.org\">bugs@openhatch.org</a>&gt;\n&gt; &lt;<a href=\"https://openhatch.org/bugs/issue37\">https://openhatch.org/bugs/issue37</a>&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________\n&gt;\n   \n", "author": "aldeka"}, {"message": "(Adding Parker and Raffi in case you have thoughts.)\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "Hey Karen -- what do you think about this?\n\n(I know you don't work for us anymore, and I don't mean to imply any sort of \nobligation from you to help us out.)\n\nMaybe we can bump the contrast on the freckly Asian girl?
