Thanks for this patch. Somehow I missed it, even though you properly\nmarked it need-review.\n\nThe patch looks good, and since it is so simple, I will deploy it immediately.\n\nIt would be great if you would email our mailing list saying you give permission\nto share it.

The arrangement of type involves the \nselection of typefaces, point size, line length, leading (line spacing), adjusting the spaces \nbetween groups of letters (tracking) and adjusting the space between pairs of letters.\n\nBut since \"Mr. Bad is embarrassed by typos\" and for me a typo could be both a typographical and \nspelling error, I should be able to commit the spacing + the spelling error, not just the spelling \nerror.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong again, maybe in English two spaces after a period is typographically fine.\n   \n", "author": "hdorio"}, {"message": "Hi hdorio,\n\nThe intended typographical error in the README is a spelling error and not a spacing error.
