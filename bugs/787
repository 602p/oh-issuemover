It's pretty \nsimple, but it has some nifty features that I will help for the future.\n\nThere's this link (requires login: \n<a href=\"http://openhatch.org/+api/v1/delete_user_for_being_spammy/\">http://openhatch.org/+api/v1/delete_user_for_being_spammy/</a> ) that, when you \nPOST, checks if you are me. If so, it lets you delete a user.\n\nBefore deleting the user, it:\n\n* Sends a data snapshot to the monitoring-private list\n\n* Emails the user indicating that we are deleting their account for spamminess \n(BCC:ing the monitoring-private list)\n\nThis way, we should be able to very easily train a simple machine learning \nfilter to detect spammy users.\n\nI'll try to make that a reality tomorrow, since the spammy users problem has \ncome up more than once.\n\nFWIW, I already used this once (successfully) to delete the user that submitted \nthe spammy Roundup update you cleaned up.\n\nOnce we have simple automated despam for the main site, I'll make it run \nperiodically. For now, I'm fine with it reporting the users to me (or the \nmonitoring-private list) and forcing me, a human, to review its results. We can \nset up a cron job on e.g. vm3.openhatch.org to check the RSS feed for the site \nand \n\nIf we are happy with how that works, I'll apply the same logic to the forum.\n\nFinally, I'll take some similar approach on the wiki. I'd say one should expect \nthat this is all ready 2-4 days from now (that's an engineer's estimate so, as \nusual, double it).\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "I'm downgrading to 'bug' now that I've disabled the links from the front page.\n\nI agree that it's important even with the front page cleaned up in this way.
