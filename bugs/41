Otherwise, Roundup seems to do a good job \nof not exposing users' email addresses.\n\nThen the next step for me is to hand-edit the data for <a href=\"issue16\">issue 16</a> so your email \naddress is gone, then close this bug, I think.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "Email addresses should be hidden/obfuscated for non-logged-in users.\n\nLet's at least make it slightly difficult for bots to harvest email addresses.\nSee <a href=\"https://openhatch.org/bugs/issue16\">https://openhatch.org/bugs/issue16</a> for an example\n   \n", "author": "voltagex"}]}
