I see the \nambiguity, but to me it looks like it's saying that there are 3 (total) other \ncontributors, where in fact there are three including me (not all other.)\n\nI suggest changing the wording so it is more clear.\n\nFor projects with more than 4 contributors, headline \"Contributors 1-4 of 25:\" \nand \nthe link read \"show all\".\n\nFor projects with 4 or less: headline \"Contributors:\" link \"show on map\".\n\nI'm undecided about whether (in the case of &gt;4 contributors) if the logged in \nuser \nshould be filtered out. Pros: it shows more info that the user doesn't know \n(showing 4 instead of 3 others.) Cons: but I like seeing my head next to projects \nI \ncare about.\n\nThanks for thinking about this, and hopefully tweaking the site.\n\nYou guys are awesome. Fantastic site, making the world a better place, and very \nfriendly and helpful responses on IRC even when I bring something that should \nhave \ngone directly into a bug report.\n\nTake care,    - Jason\n   \n", "author": "JasonWoof"}]}
