It survived this long? ;P\n\nThere are several routes that could be taken with this. I separated the trackers\nby tracker type, but it may be more beneficial to use a (paginated) table with\nname and type, and have some kind of sorting (like bug tracker interfaces). Then\nthe delete links could be turned into a checkbox-and-dropdown-type system for\nbulk action (although I doubt we will ever need to delete enough trackers at\nonce to warrant this). Or, we could go for something more \"interesting\" with a\ngrid-style flow (still grouped by type as-is, or maybe just entirely alphabetical).\n\nFor adding trackers, it may be more intuitive to have a single add link, that\nshows a pop-up with the various tracker-types as images that link to the\ncorresponding add page (similar to the OpenID login page).\n\nFor the add/edit page, tabs would reduce the amount of visible information,\nmaking the page easier to comprehend. Or maybe a wizard for addition.\n\nOh, and the \"Created for project\" field NEEDS fixing - it currently shows a\nrepresentation of the entire model, not just the name. Is this affecting the\nbackend as well (i.e. what projects bugs are assigned to) or just the display?\nIIRC I had this field auto-complete based on the chosen name (or I had the\nintention to make it do that, or have a search or something).\n   \n", "author": "pythonian4000"}, {"message": "Design for review a new design / flow for the /customs subsection of the site.\n   \n", "author": "havel"}]}
