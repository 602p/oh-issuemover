The \nlink to the patch man page is a good start, though -- we just need to hide away the intermediate \nand easy hints until the user asks for them.\n\nOn the third and fourth, there's hardly any hints at all. Links to documentation for grep and the \nsyntax for sending a patch output to a file would be helpful here.\n   \n", "author": "aldeka"}]}
