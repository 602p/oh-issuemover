But there are two other dependencies of the rebase\nmission!\n\nI'd either continue checking the dependencies of all the prerequisite missions,\nand send the user back to the first one, or *start* at the first mission in that\ncategory, check the later ones, and return the first one the user hasn't done. I\ndon't know if multiple prerequisites are possible or desirable, though, so the\nlatter choice might not be helpful.\n\nThis would definitely cut the number of page loads per attempt at accessing a\nmission they can't do yet.\n   \n", "author": "MarkTraceur"}]}
