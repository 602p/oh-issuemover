When right-clicked and \"Saved As...\", \nthe file is renamed from \"nobel.py\" to \"nobel.py.txt\".\n\nLater in step 4 ( CLI: \"python nobel.py\" ), the filename doesn't match, \nand a student was observed to be visibly confused.\n\nI think this might be a server side issue over at the mit.edu server \nwhere the script is stored, which is running Apache. So, this might be \nfixable with a custom .htaccess file in\n <a href=\"http://mit.edu/jesstess/www/BostonPythonWorkshop5/\">http://mit.edu/jesstess/www/BostonPythonWorkshop5/</a>\n\nI think this has to do with \"Content-Disposition\".\n\nAnother solution might be to move the file to openhatch.org (for example \nto \"/var/www/BostonPythonWorkshop5/pyfiles/\"), where you have the \nliberty of configuring nginx.conf with per-directory custom Content-\nDisposition header:\n\nlocation /files/BostonPythonWorkshop5/ {\n        root /var/www/BostonPythonWorkshop5/pyfiles/;\n        add_header Content-Disposition 'attachment;\n    }\n\nOr something like that. Hope this helps!\n   \n", "author": "alx"}]}
