I think it would be helpful users of all os, if they don't have prior\nexperience.  \n\nSome ideas:\n\n1. For windows install cygwin (or some other tool that will allow unix-ish commands)\n2. Build on the 'tar' mission, or 'git' mission where the user downloads some\nfiles / data.\n3. Have a scavenger hunt where the user has to traverse the files to find the\nanswers to various questions, or do some basic manipulation (search / replace)\n\nCommands that could be taught could start with the basics: ls, cd, mv, cp.\nCould get a bit more advanced, grep | wc\npossibly include my most favorite search / replace, perl pie:\nperl -p -i -e 's/something/something_else/g' file \n\nCould be verified by asking some questions or having the user make changes, and\nthen commit, or upload a new tar ball.\n   \n", "author": "janet"}]}
