The widget\non the Twisted home page could pull data from OpenHatch's project page.\n\nIn order to achieve that, the OpenHatch project page for Twisted ought to list \nthese numbers in a machine readable format. Then hopefully excited community \nmembers would design boxes like that for their projects.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}]}
