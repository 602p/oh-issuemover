On the left there's \n\"profile\" and on the right is another that has my name displayed but both are the same \nlink.\n\nI thought maybe it was a different view of the data but looks the same. Can free up some \nreal estate by deleting the first one (\"profile\"). \n\nWhile we're up there, if logged out, the header is:\n* people\n* projects\n* volunteer opportunities\n* missions\n\nLogged in is:\n* home\n* profile\n* all people\n* all projects\n* volunteer opportunities\n* missions\n\nWhy the difference? Recommend that it be consistent. I'm torn on the need for \"home.\" I \nusually click the logo but some think it helps usu usability a lot to have so maybe keep \nit? But can probably drop \"all\" from the people and project links.\n   \n", "author": "jessica"}]}
