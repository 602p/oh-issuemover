So there some change in \nneeded to apply the code tags written under 'li' elements/tags. There are more \npages suffering from this issue.\n\nother pages are\n\n<a href=\"http://openhatch.org/missions/diffpatch/recursive_diff\">http://openhatch.org/missions/diffpatch/recursive_diff</a>\n<a href=\"http://openhatch.org/missions/svn/diff\">http://openhatch.org/missions/svn/diff</a>\n<a href=\"http://openhatch.org/missions/svn/commit\">http://openhatch.org/missions/svn/commit</a>\n\nI have changed the CSS in base.less\nul.raquo_bullets {\n    ....\n    li{\n        ....\n        code {\n            ....\n        }\n    }\n}\n   \n", "author": "chitrankdixit"}, {"message": "As a clarification here:\n\nThe \"In general...\" sentence is probably not very clear; feel free to ignore it. \nIt seems I accidentally switched mid-sentence to talking about the problem and \ntalking about the solution.\n\nYou'll probably want to try changing a few HTML properties using the \nFireBug/Chrome DOM inspector, to get a sense of what effects would be caused by \ndifferent possible changes.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "On <a href=\"http://openhatch.org/missions/diffpatch/recursive_patch\">http://openhatch.org/missions/diffpatch/recursive_patch</a> , I see the following \noddity.\n\nIn the bullet beginning with \"Unpack the tarball. This will create a familiar...\" \nthe word \"recipes\" appears offset to the point where it is partly obscured.\n\nIn general, what seems to be happening is that the CODE element should either \n\"clear: both;\" (in CSS; explained here: \n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12871710/why-clear-both-css\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12871710/why-clear-both-css</a> ), or something \nelse should be done...\n\nThere are two reasonable fixes that I can think of. One would be to apply the \n\"clearfix\" class to the li.raquo_bullets in that page. Another would be to add \nsome CSS rules so that, on this page, the CODE tag is \"display: inline;\".\n\nYou can find which CSS files affect that page by running a local server, then \ndoing 'view source'. You'll find that localhost:8000/static/ corresponds to \nmysite/static/.\n\nOh -- another way to do it is to add a special CSS class to these CODE tags that \nshould have the \"display: inline;\" property. This would require creating a new \nCSS class in our collection of CSS classes, which is a good thing to do \ngenerally.\n\n\nTo find the right HTML template file, I recommend running this in your terminal:\n\ngit grep \"This will create a familiar\"\n\nYou will probably see just one file.\n\n\nOnce you fix it, you'll need to submit a pull request. Feel free to ask Asheesh \n(me, aka paulproteus) for help as you progress through this. Additionally, it \nwould be great if you can look at other pages within the \"training missions\" part \nof the site to see if they suffer from the same problem, and if your fix fixes \nthat, too.\n\nNote that there is a general reason that the CODE tag is formatted that way, even \nthough it's exhibiting this awful current behavior. The idea is that if a CODE \ntag is really wide, then we want to make sure there is a scrollbar.
