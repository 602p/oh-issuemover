I think\nthat realistically the last_polled should be changed when the CSV is fetched.\n\n* You worry about concurrency in self.prepare_bug_urls, but for what it's worth,\nwith Twisted, only one Python line ever runs at a time. In fact, only one\nfunction can be running at a time. (Twisted is just asynchronous I/O; it doesn't\ndo anything tricky like threading.)\n\n* There are some comment typos that I fix in a patch on top of this.\n\n* You copy a list, and then remove items from it. Best to create a new list with\njust the parts you want. I fix that in a commit on top.\n\nOtherwise, it looks good. I'm pushing this to origin/master (meaning, Hudson,\ntoo); once Hudson is happy, I will deploy.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "Finished:\n<a href=\"http://git.jackgrigg.com/openhatch/patch/?id=66a4280a11e55c455e0f712eab34f7172eafb7a9\">http://git.jackgrigg.com/openhatch/patch/?id=66a4280a11e55c455e0f712eab34f7172eafb7a9</a>\n   \n", "author": "pythonian4000"}, {"message": "This issue is tracked in <a href=\"issue260\">issue260</a>.\n   \n", "author": "pythonian4000"}]}
