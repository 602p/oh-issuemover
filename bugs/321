So I have no way to select the projects.

I think doing it in JavaScript runs \nthe risk of having zero results to show (because you've excluded all the \nprojects that would show up), so you'll need to do at least *something* \nserver-side too, I think.\n\nThis a good bug for a new-ish contributor, but not the kind of thing someone \nshould do *first*.
