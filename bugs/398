I \nsuggest not doing that; semicolons aren't actually idiomatic Python. (This might \nstem from the way I suggested fixing it yesterday; sorry if that misled you.)\n\n* The lines you added end with a \" \" (space) character. We try to avoid that. Can \nyou remove that from your lines?\n\nI wonder if you can modify this commit on your machine in those ways. You can use \n\"git commit --amend\" to amend the patch, or \"git rebase --interactive\" to \"e\"dit \nthe commit. I can explain more on IRC.\n\nAlso, if you would add:\n\n\"Closes: <a href=\"http://openhatch.org/bugs/issue398\">http://openhatch.org/bugs/issue398</a>\"\n\non a line of its own, at the end of the commit log message, then it'll be easier \nfor people browsing git history to see the full history of the change.\n\nHaving said all that -- thank you for this patch! It's really good to have \nchanges that permit the code to run inside a virtualenv. Perhaps in the future \nwe'll modify the setup process so that we require a virtualenv to avoid conflicts \nlike you ran into, and your work makes that possible.\n\nIf you haven't emailed Devel saying you're okay with releasing your work here \nunder the AGPLv3, take a look at the \"Permit us to share your work\" section at \n<a href=\"http://openhatch.org/wiki/How_we_handle_patches#Permit_us_to_share_your_work:\">http://openhatch.org/wiki/How_we_handle_patches#Permit_us_to_share_your_work:</a> !\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "With paulproteus's help, updated Image imports so that I could get a local copy of \nthe code running :)\n\nHe said to make a patch and submit it so here it is.\n   \n", "author": "jessica"}]}
