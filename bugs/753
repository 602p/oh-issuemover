Anyone is welcome to do it. It \nrequires no programming skill, just a willingness to use git.\n\nHere's how to fix it:\n\n1. Make sure you have a local version of oh-mainline\n\n2. When in that, execute: \"cd vendor/packages\"\n\n3. Use git to remove the entire embedded copy of Django (you might need to pass \nsome special arguments to git rm to remove a the directory)\n\n4. \"cd ../..\" to get back to oh-mainline/\n\n5. pip install --no-install --build=vendor/packages --src=vendor/src -I django\n\n6. Make sure you got a version you like\n\n7. Use \"git add\" to add the new vendor/packages/Django version to git\n\n8. run \"python manage.py shell\" and do \"import django; print django.VERSION\" to \nmake sure we're on a safe version of Django\n\n9. Submit a pull request to oh-mainline\n\nI can be a mentor for doing any of this, as needed. Ping me on IRC if you like!\n\nAs a side note, we should write documentation in our repository for how to \nupgrade and install embeddeded dependencies.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}]}
