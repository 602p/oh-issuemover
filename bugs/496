What kinds of events should go on the OpenHatch calendar?\n\nA. We want to promote events that directly bring new contributors into free \nsoftware, or teach background needed to participate in free software projects. We \nonly list events that are free-of-cost or reasonably inexpensive to attend. They \ncan be in person or online.\n\nTo us, there is a grey area where some events teach how to use proprietary \nsoftware. If those events are free of cost and explicitly about helping users \ncontribute to free software, then they can go on the calendar, too. For all these \nevents, it's fine if there is a cap to the maximum number of attendees. We'd \nappreciate if you could update the OpenHatch calendar when the event fills up.\n\nTo give you ideas, here are a few types of events we like:\n\nOnline ,\"Open house\" events, like Debian's \"One day with Debian Perl Team\" on \nJuly 1, 2011 &lt;<a href=\"http://lists.debian.org/debian-perl/2011/07/msg00002.html\">http://lists.debian.org/debian-perl/2011/07/msg00002.html</a>&gt;\nDiversity outreach events for in-person programming meetups, like the Boston \nPython Workshop that OpenHatch co-organizes \n&lt;<a href=\"http://openhatch.org/wiki/Boston_Python_Workshop_3\">http://openhatch.org/wiki/Boston_Python_Workshop_3</a>&gt;\nParties to get newcomers involved in a free software project, like the Debian Bug \nSquashing Party held at MIT in December 2008 &lt;<a href=\"http://lists.debian.org/debian-\">http://lists.debian.org/debian-</a>\ndevel/2008/12/<a href=\"msg00513\">msg00513</a>.html&gt;\nPeriodic meetings that are open to new contributors, like P2PU's weekly code \nstatus meetings: <a href=\"https://github.com/p2pu/lernanta/wiki/Dev-Meetings-2011\">https://github.com/p2pu/lernanta/wiki/Dev-Meetings-2011</a>\n(Theoretically) A free-of-cost hack fest that teaches how to use Adobe \nIllustrator to design logos for free software projects.\n\nWe're not particularly interested in events that simply teach how to use free \nsoftware. To qualify, you have to be teaching skills needed in free software \ncontribution (like programming) or directly getting people involved.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "I will try to work on this during the coming week.\n\n(Honestly it should take me 30 minutes to write a draft.)\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "I like writing things like this, so for now I will take it.\n\nI will ask for review+feedback from other people before it is \"official\".\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}]}
