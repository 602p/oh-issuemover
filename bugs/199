I know that's the way the rest of them work, but I wonder what you think.\n\n* The CSS you added to to templates/missions/main.html would be better if it\nwere in a .css file. Something we often do is give the &lt;body&gt; tag on certain\npages like that a specific class so you can put that in your selector. See e.g.\nmysite/project/templates/edit_project.html\n\n* It'd be great to have the source files. For those, a somewhat unusual process:\nGo to <a href=\"http://gitorious.org/openhatch/oh-bigfiles\">http://gitorious.org/openhatch/oh-bigfiles</a> and click \"Clone repository\",\nthen clone your personal oh-bigfiles repo, and add the source files, and do a\n\"git push\".
