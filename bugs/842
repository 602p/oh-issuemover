To do that, do a 'runserver' and visit a project page, and hover around \nsomething that is supposed to generate the \"tipsy\" and make sure that you see a \n404 message printed either your browser console, or (easier) in the output of \nmanage.py runserver (aka the web server log).\n\nThen, after digging up the file and putting it into place, go visit a project \npage, and make sure that you no longer get a 404 printed to your web server log. \nAlso you'll be treated to some kind of exciting image in the web browser. (I \ntotally forget what the tipsy image looks like, but I bet you will know.)\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "Probably the fix is to find the original source of the image, make sure it is \nfreely licensed, and then include it in the repo at the right place.\n\nThat, or we can stop referencing it so that even though it is missing, we don't \n404.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "When I do a GET of e.g.\n\n<a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/+projects/GeoTrellis\">http://127.0.0.1:8000/+projects/GeoTrellis</a>\n\nI see in my local log:\n\n[20/Mar/2013 19:07:53] \"GET /static/images/tipsy.gif HTTP/1.1\" 404 1790\n\nDoing 'git ls-files | grep tipsy' shows that it is indeed missing.\n\nI... wonder why it is missing.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}]}
