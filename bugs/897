What does it gain us that having the \nability to do a multi-level sort (sort by X then Y than Z) gets?  It's not an \nintuitive interface.  If we decide to keep it, I suggest displaying the phrase \n\"Group By: X\" with the variable being grouped by at the top with the other \ncolumn titles.  That will hopefully make it clearer to users.\n\n* We should display keywords in the main tracker.  Right now the only way to \nknow what keywords exist (and therefore what you can search for) is to go the \nsearch option in the sidebar (<a href=\"http://openhatch.org/bugs/issue?@template=search\">http://openhatch.org/bugs/issue?@template=search</a>), \nfind the keyword dropdown (one of 17 options in the advanced search), and select \na keyword there.  Consequently, I don't think anyone except experienced users \nsearches by keyword.\n\n* I think we should create a \"How to use the issue tracker\" docs page and \nprominently link to it.  I also think we should create a \"How to develop the \nissue tracker\" docs page (based off this: \n<a href=\"https://openhatch.org/wiki/Maintaining_the_OpenHatch_bug_tracker\">https://openhatch.org/wiki/Maintaining_the_OpenHatch_bug_tracker</a> but that's \nincomplete, and also confusingly on the wiki).  Currently at the bottom of the \nlefthand sidebar there's a title \"Help\" with \"Bug tracker docs\" linking to \n<a href=\"http://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs.html.\">http://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs.html.</a>  I suggest moving \"Help\" to the top of \nthe lefthand sidebar and putting links to the newly created readthedocs pages \nfor users and developers underneath.  The roundup website can be linked from the \ndevelopers readthedocs page.\n\n* Browsing through the bugs, they frequently don't have enough information for \nnew contributors to address.  Is there a way to encourage people to provide more \nthorough reports, perhaps by use of the status \"need-example\" (which could \nperhaps be broadened to \"need-info\")?  Otherwise I will have to delete the \"how \nto write an awesome bug report\" slide from the tools presentation in shame.  :(\n   \n", "author": "shauna"}]}
