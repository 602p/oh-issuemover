Thanks for adding this.\n\nI have added three small style fixes:\n\n* Whitespace around punctuation: I changed \"correct ,check\" to \"correct, check\"\n\n* Punctuation: The sentence you changed should end with a period (\".\"), so I I\nadded that.\n\n* I adjusted the text so it still fits in short columns that file typically uses.\n\nI've pushed these changes, and marked this as resolved. Thanks, and looking\nforward to more patches!
