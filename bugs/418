Do we just show bitesize or all? \n\nTraining missions:\n* Show progress. This might mean some tinkering of the mission model. \n\n* I did see somewhere in code a way to list people that have completed it. Not \nsure if that'd be interesting but maybe? \"Join 73 other people that have finished \nthe SVN mission\" or such.\n\n* I would love to see a list of all missions dynamically so that we can say \"new\" \nor \"updated?\" or such. Again, might mean tinkering with the missions model unless \nI didn't understand the methods right.\n\nPeople:\n\n* Number of people shown should be limited to maybe 5?\n\n* Add \"mentors\" list\n\n___Attract contributors tab___\n\n* It maybe should link to projects you're a part of, particular show the ones \nthat have wannahelpers. - Asheesh\n\n* It should maybe provide a 'nudge' to fill out the project page, if it's blank. \n- Asheesh\n\n* If one of the projects doesn't have any Bug objects associated with it, it \ncould (for now) link to the wiki page about adding a bug tracker. (Soon, maybe \nlater today, there'll be an in-site UI for that.) - Asheesh \n\n* Maybe link to places/help on how to grow/maintain community? Ideas on where to \nfind developers? Related to: <a href=\"https://openhatch.org/bugs/issue323\">https://openhatch.org/bugs/issue323</a>\n\n* Feature new developers? Or new user with contact information filled out that is \ninterested in that language but maybe hasn't seen that project?\n\n* Social networking tie-in? \"Tweet this\" for \"Want to get started in open source? \nGain fame, fortune (of praise).\" + shortened url to their bitesize bugs on \nopenhatch? with good hashtags? and how to set up a page on Facebook? Not sure \nabout that. Or maybe which pages would be good to \"advertise\" on?\n\n* List of colleges nearby with ACM chapters or area LUGS or again more \"where to \nfind people\" type ideas.\n\n* List of people that said \"I wanna help\" and a way to contact them. Related to: \n<a href=\"http://openhatch.org/bugs/issue282\">http://openhatch.org/bugs/issue282</a> and <a href=\"http://openhatch.org/bugs/issue408\">http://openhatch.org/bugs/issue408</a> \n\n \n\nPlease add your ideas. We can always push some to later milestones but definitely \nhope we keep iteratively improving these landing pages :)\n   \n", "author": "jessica"}]}
