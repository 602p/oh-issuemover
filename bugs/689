These can cause merge conflicts for\nno good reason, so it's best to trim the spaces off.\n\n* It's better to submit separate commits for separate things, so the file rename\nhere should be a separate commit from the actual template change.\n\n* Similar concern as above: You changed base.css without a separate commit, so\nit's hard to know why you removed \"background: white;\"\n\nI'll take it; it does address the problem!
