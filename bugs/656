When I download it\nfrom the server (on both windows and ubuntu), I cannot open it with the hint\ngiven in the mission. I get the same error as C_open does. It's probably (like\npaulproteus said) a flaw with the tar file being sent out by the server.\n\nA simple workaround is just to use gunzip or gzip to decompress to a .tar first,\nand then unpackage it from there with \"tar xvf ghello-0.4.tar\". This solution\nwould only require a simple change in the instructions.\n\nAnother solution is that we create a working tarball and simply host it on the\nserver for people to download, rather than just generating it on request. \n\nI'm not 100% why it is the way it is now, as I'm fairly new to the project (and\nopen source projects as well). Whichever solution is preferred can be done. \n\nHope I helped. :)\n   \n", "author": "xiaobai"}, {"message": "That makes sense and solves a headache of mine. You guys have been\namazingly helpful.
