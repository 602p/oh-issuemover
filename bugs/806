I attended Jessica's open source tutorial run \nthis weekend, and disocvered a minor issue which I thought I'd report.\nI was using windows during the course.\nThe course recommended git-bash as a cli.\nThe mission page <a href=\"https://openhatch.org/missions/diffpatch/single_patch\">https://openhatch.org/missions/diffpatch/single_patch</a> (click \nhint level high)\nThe hint text recommends using \"wget\" to download the files of interest.\ngit-bash on windows does not include wget. I just checked the three machines I \nhave. None has wget.\ngit-bash does have curl which provideds the same functionality.\nI suggest the hint changed to use curl.\nOne can also download and install wget, which I did at the tutorial \nexcept that is time taken away from the tutorial.\n   \n", "author": "makearney"}]}
