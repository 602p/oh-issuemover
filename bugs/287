The reason is that this \nshift towards customizing the site experience for maintainers and new contributors means we \nshould probably have distinct e-mails, or at least 2 different sections of the weekly e-mail: a \nmaintainer updates section and a new contributor section (you currently get weekly e-mails for all \nprojects in your portfolio and for which you've clicked the 'I want to help' button).\n\nI think that level of change is outside the scope of this ticket.
