This patch looks great, and makes a big difference. I'm merging and\ndeploying it now.\n\nOne thing worth mentioning is that git complains about \"whitespace errors\". I\nlooked into that, and within the line you added that starts with \"If you are\nlooking to list a project\", it ends with a \" \" (space) character.\n\nEnding lines with space characters can be problematic because it can create\nunnecessary merge conflicts. So I've added a commit on top of this that removes\nthat space at the end of the line.\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/openhatch/oh-\">https://github.com/openhatch/oh-</a>\nmainline/commit/3eb0772ca035e7d8fe53a66d5754c81a7466eebc\n\n(-: !,\n\n-- Asheesh.\n\n----------\nstatus: need-review -&gt; resolved\n\n__________________________________________\nRoundup issue tracker &lt;<a href=\"mailto:bugs@openhatch.org\">bugs@openhatch.org</a>&gt;\n&lt;<a href=\"https://openhatch.org/bugs/issue839\">https://openhatch.org/bugs/issue839</a>&gt;\n__________________________________________\n   \n", "author": "florapdx"}, {"message": "Hi Flora!
