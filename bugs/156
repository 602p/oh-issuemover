I\nwrote a test that fails that demonstrates this.\n\n* You had a test method whose name was unusual stylistically. I wrote commit\n96b1e3f9b4f64858ecca2066b6c476098e0af76b to fix that.\n\n* Also, in the Person test, it would be valuable to delete the User objects,\ntoo, before you do the import. (That properly simulates a blank database that\npeople will probably import into.) I add that to your test, and it still passes\n-- so good!\n\n* I realized we make everyone's email address be the empty string, and I kind of\nexpect weird things to happen with that the way it is. So I made email address\nhandling more complex; you can read the corresponding test in DataExport.\n\nI pushed this to origin/master even though it has broken tests (namely, the ones\nI added).
