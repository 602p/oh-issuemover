However, we are actually not using the field for\nanything.\n\nWe should:\n\n* Remove all reference to it from search/models.py\n* Add a migration that updates the database in a corresponding fashion\n* Remove references to bite_size_tag_name from other parts of the code\n* Make sure the tests pass.\n\nThis is a fairly easy ticket, but because it requires writing a migration, it is\nslightly more difficult than a truly \"bitesized\" issue.\n\n(<a href=\"https://openhatch.org/wiki/Adding_a_field_to_the_profile\">https://openhatch.org/wiki/Adding_a_field_to_the_profile</a> has information on how\nto add a migration.)\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}]}
