I'm thrilled and relieved that you're choosing to \nwork with us for as long as you do.\n\nThis patch is deployed.\n\n(glyph, log in and take a look.

Sorry about that!\n\nAlso, sorry about the extra white space at the end. I turned on space\nidentifiers in Eclipse so hopefully cleaned up trails this time. \n\nIf not, I can get them in version 11.05 probably.\n\nRight-o.\n\nChanged \"Recommended people/collaborators\" to be \"Collaborators\" if in a\nproject. If not, it's \"Potential collaborators\" which is randPeople(). Mentors\nwould be great for 11.05.\n\nI didn't notice nudges and have put them back in. Nudge on mission and nudge on\nbugs. AKA, if no missions, nudge text. If no tags, nudge text.\n\nMission status if in progress should be 11.05 (unless someone can do that cause\nI'm out of time).\n\nYes, moved stuff around. I followed the mockup since it was agreed on but did a\nlittle shuffling. Also, did the CSS a little differently so the boxes don't\nfloat to fit. This means white space but means consistency as well.\n\nYes, to a better \"Attract new contributors\" page but I don't have extra time\ntoday. Already behind on some other stuff :) Definitely agree that should be in\n11.05. \n\nWhatever doesn't get in 11.04 will appear in a new bug to continue making the\nlogged in user landing pages more dynamic.\n\n-------Edit-------\nChanged a few things based on IRC feedback but there's a more recent screen shot:\n<a href=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5186/5673845559_4515c78bfb_o.png\">http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5186/5673845559_4515c78bfb_o.png</a> - User has no\nmissions, but wants to help one project\n\nOther screenshots from before the IRC feedback (stuff moved around and a little\ntweak on text):\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/digifoo/sets/72157626493175573/show/\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/digifoo/sets/72157626493175573/show/</a>\n\n\nPatch attached\n   \n", "author": "jessica"}, {"message": "Hi Jessica,\n\nA few thoughts as I review the patch:\n\n* The changes to .gitignore should really be their own commit.\n\n* Some of the changes you made make git complain about 'whitespace errors'. That \nusually means you ended a line with some \" \" (space) characters. git doesn't like \nthat, in part because it can sometimes cause merge conflicts meaninglessly.\n\n* I get a TemplateSyntaxError because mysite.missions.svn.views.about is not a \nvalid function. It's mysite.missions.svn.views.main_page ; same with the tar \nview. (I fixed that locally when reviewing so the page would render.)\n\nNitpicking aside, some more meaningful comments:\n\n* Wow, this is so good.\n\n* \"Recommended people\" maybe should be \"People you've collaborated with\", since \nthat's all it is for now, and it could be smaller, since it's not actually that \nexciting. Probably we should improve this to say, \"People you should probably \ncontact\" and list prospective mentors!?!?!!? (*excited but timid gulp*)\n\n* The text for if you haven't done the missions could maybe explain what the \nmissions are, in case you don't know. We used to have a \"Nudge\" for missions on \nthe old logged-in landing page; maybe you could use something like that?\n\n* Also, it says: \"I have helped: No projects listed yet.\" -- not true! This \nshould be the list of projects that appear in my profile. You can nab this from \nmysite.models.Person.get_list_of_all_project_names() -- note that this method \nonly gets the ones that are 'published', which I think is fine.\n\n* Maybe the 'Projects' part of the page should move to the top half, since along \nwith missions it's the most useful thing.\n\nI presume you know the 'Attract new contributors' tab is mostly the same. I think \nwe can add some things to it, if you're up for it:\n\n* It maybe should link to projects you're a part of, particular show the ones \nthat have wannahelpers.\n\n* It should maybe provide a 'nudge' to fill out the project page, if it's blank.\n\n* If one of the projects doesn't have any Bug objects associated with it, it \ncould (for now) link to the wiki page about adding a bug tracker. (Soon, maybe \nlater today, there'll be an in-site UI for that.)\n\nI guess it does do all those things right now, in theory, but because it's the \nsame as if I'm not logged in and it doesn't mention anything personal to me, I \nignore the old links. That's the way my brain works, I guess. Maybe others' work \nsimilarly.\n\nThat's what I have for you. One more thing: this is *phenomenal*.
