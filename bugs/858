Thanks for filing this bug, and for finding the code changes that fix \nit, and *most* for writing the test.\n\nThis code looks great, and I'm going to merge and deploy it immediately.\n\nHaving said that, I would prefer if you also indicate more of the rationale for \nthe change in the commit log message. That you fixed an issue is good, but it's \nbetter to explain the code that caused bug in English somewhere. The commit log \nmessage is often a great place for that.\n\n...done! Marking resolved!\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "Steps to reproduce:\n\n1. Go to <a href=\"http://www.openhatch.org/search/\">http://www.openhatch.org/search/</a>\n2.
