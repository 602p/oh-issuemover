That function initializes an empty dictionary called \"context\". It adds a key \n'random_pfentry' with a value returned by p.get_random_description() where 'p' is \nthe Project object. \n\n3. In mysite/search/models.py (the Project models are in the Search app) the \nfunction get_random_description() builds a list called pfentries from a call to \nself.get_pfentries_with_usable_descriptions(), which builds its list from \nget_pfentries_with_descriptions. \n\n4. pfentries gets contstructed in the get_pfentries_with_descriptions() function. \nIt generates a list (from a QuerySet?) of projects, but it excludes all projects \nthat have a project_description == \"\".\n\n5. Back to get_random_description(). If pfentries is an non-empty list, \nget_random_description() returns a random list item. If pfentries is an empty list, \nget_random_description() returns None.\n\n6. In mysite/project/templates/project/project.html (the template that renders the \nproject page), there is a conditional {%if random_pfentry %}. If this is true (i.e. \nthe context['random_pfentry'] value is not None, the template renders the supplied \nproject_description value that was chosen in step 5. If the conditional is false \n(i.e. step 5 returned None) then the template renders a message saying that \"no one \nhas described this project yet\". \n\nEffectively, this functionality pulls the description from a random user's \ndescription of the project (provided at least one user has described the project). \nIf you add a project to your profile and open up your portfoloio editor \n(<a href=\"http://openhatch.org/+portfolio/editor/\">http://openhatch.org/+portfolio/editor/</a>) you can add your description of the \nproject. This will be part of the set of desciptions that step 5 chooses at random. \n\nI think the intent is for this page to show how different users have described the \nproject.\n\nIf I've misinterpreted anything and someone more knowledgeable than I wants to \nweigh in I'd be glad to know where I erred.\n   \n", "author": "gehrhorn"}, {"message": "Right now, the project page takes the project description (in the \"About {{ \nproject.name }}\" box) from some random contributor's profile, as far as I can tell. \nWhich is perfectly fine default behavior.
