So I figured it's best to wait to find out if it made things \nworse.\n\nTurns out it didn't.\n\nAs someone who has deployed (not just pushed, *deployed*) *syntax errors*, I know \nthat care is important. So I figure, this time, let's be calm and let the unit \ntests run. If the unit tests aren't all working, then now is not a good time to \ndeploy any code.\n\nAfter <a href=\"http://gitorious.org/openhatch/oh-\">http://gitorious.org/openhatch/oh-</a>\nmainline/commit/e07ee0dd028747fe055099c1d205ac039a787913 , the tests all pass.
