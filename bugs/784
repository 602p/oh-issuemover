(Also, I'm the one who introduced the error, \nas demonstrated by this command:)\n\ngit log -p mysite/missions/templates/missions/diffpatch/recursive_diff.html\n\nThe patch looks great, and if you see any other issues related to spelling, \ndocumentation, code, or otherwise, do please file more bugs. The patch you've \nsubmitted is surgical, changing only the lines needed to make the spelling fix, \nand I appreciate that!\n\nI'm going to merge it into master and deploy it immediately, and mark this \nresolved. MarkTraceur's point about running aspell might work as another good \nway to detect further errors. (If we keep introducing problems like this, it \nmight be worth trying to automate the spell checking.)\n\nOne more thing I'd like to ask of you, Betsy: Please permit us to share your \nwork per our usual process at \n<a href=\"http://openhatch.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributor/handling_patches.html#per\">http://openhatch.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributor/handling_patches.html#per</a>\nmit-us-to-share-your-work .
