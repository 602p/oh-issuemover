I don't have an idea how tracker spider work, but it is \nconvenient to think about this as a separate component (Django Application?), which \ncan be queried for status. So, a description page with a diagram of OpenHatch \ncomponents is definitely needed. The edit page is probably not the best place for \nlooking for the trackers status, but exposing it there as a first step is already a \nbig deal.\n\nThere is one more reason about reusability of the OpenHatch code that is out of \nscope of this tracker completely. The main point that it is not fun to study code \nunless:\n\n  1. it is awesome\n  2. I can reuse it\n  3. I have some time\n\nIf all three match, I start to get my hands dirty, but for OpenHatch it is more 1, \nno 2 and a little of 3. It doesn't mean that I won't do anything, but incentive is \nlow, and probability is also low as a result. =)\n   \n", "author": "techtonik"}, {"message": "techtonik, thanks for filing this bug.\n\nI think that it would be great to add status information to the bug \ntracker info page.\n\nHere's what I imagine we could do:\n\nOn e.g. this URL:\n\n<a href=\"http://openhatch.org/customs/edit/bugzilla/KDE%20Bugzilla\">http://openhatch.org/customs/edit/bugzilla/KDE%20Bugzilla</a>\n\nyou see the \"tracker URL\" sections. Those could have a \"Last crawl\" \ncolumn, which gives the (UTC) date of the last crawl.\n\nThere could be an info link that reminds/explains how the crawl works.\n\nThat wouldn't be too hard to add. I don't know if I personally can get it \ninto 0.12.02, but I would be happy to show you (or others) how to add it, \nand shepherd the patch to being merged!\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "I've added tracker for `rietveld` and it didn't appear yet.
