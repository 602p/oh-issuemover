The mission is great for\ninstalling Git Bash but terrible at explaining what Git Bash is, how to use it,\nor -worst of all- how to help yourself.\n\nThe mission assumes that the user has no prior experience with command lines. \nIt provides a bare-bones explanation of what a command line is while forgetting\nto mention the important details of the Git Bash command line (The commands are\nUnix commands!  If you need to look up basic commands, you have to look up Unix\ncommands, not Git Bash commands.  It also fails to explain basic syntax, such as\nhow to use options.  It \"shows\" the use of the command line with minimal\nexamples, such as: \"type cd,\" or \"type ls\"  But, it doesn't explain other basic\nfunctions, such as moving files, nor does it explain any kind of basic practice\nof the command line.\n\nThen, the next missions launch into using the command line to create tars and\ndiffs.  This ends poorly.  \n\nAt the moment, continuing on to the other missions requires you to abandon the\nopen-hatch site in order to find a resource to learn how to use the Git Bash\ncommand line from scratch.  At the very least, there needs to be a list of\nresources on the command line so that users can learn how to use it without\nhaving to randomly search the internet for a quality resource, or harass the\nopen hatch irc channel like I did.\n\nI would suggest at the least a more detailed explanation of what Git Bash is and\nhow its command line differs from the windows command line while also providing\nlinks to learning resources.\n   \n", "author": "narroo"}]}
