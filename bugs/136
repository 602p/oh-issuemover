We'd love a login drop-down from the main openhatch login \nlink...\n<a href=\"http://uxmovement.com/forms/dropdown-login-boxes-for-faster-\">http://uxmovement.com/forms/dropdown-login-boxes-for-faster-</a>\nlogin\n\n2. That we should have a off-site login page that will contain \nexactly the same content like...\n<a href=\"http://gawker.zendesk.com/access/unauthenticated?return_to=http\">http://gawker.zendesk.com/access/unauthenticated?return_to=http</a>\n%3A%2F%2Fgawker.zendesk.com%2Flogin\n\n3. Dropdowns are ugly and less comfortable than buttons &amp; tabs.\n\n4. Sign-up and login pages are exactly the same, so merge \nthem. - \n        a. If you have an account already then you have the \noption to add / merge that new login type with a your current \nopenhatch account.\n        b. If you don't have an account already then using \nwhatever login type will create a new openhatch account.\n        c. Things to validate duplicate users should be \nlocation or username, and you can't login using another login \ntype that has been already been used with an existing account. \n(need more suggestions...)\n\nso I will get a couple of mockups together...\nA) for on-site drop-down login \nB) For off-site (Roundup &amp; wiki)\n\nAnd I think we can still do a cool throbber to show whilst \nsign up / login happens - something spunky, that shows that \nhow OpenHatch is so awesome.\n   \n", "author": "palhmbs"}, {"message": "I like this - it is self-contained and not specific to any part of OpenHatch, so\nthe central login system makes a bit more sense.\n\nAlso, it should have a \"Cancel\" or \"Back\" button/link that returns you from\nwhence you came.\n   \n", "author": "pythonian4000"}, {"message": "More like this - (see attached screenshot).\n   \n", "author": "palhmbs"}, {"message": "Like this? <a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/log_in\">http://www.vimeo.com/log_in</a>\n\nOr <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\">https://www.facebook.com/</a> (when not logged in)?\n   \n", "author": "jessica"}, {"message": "Can we agree on getting rid of all site navigation?\n   \n", "author": "palhmbs"}, {"message": "Started a diagram:\n<a href=\"https://cacoo.com/diagrams/YVZ6b3aXKkbQdQz1\">https://cacoo.com/diagrams/YVZ6b3aXKkbQdQz1</a>\n\nAnyone can edit, probably. Maybe. My first time using cacoo other than as an \nobserver :)\n\nSpunk could also just be when you click \"log in\" in the upper right that it drops \ndown a username/password field or openid link / click here to login with Google.\n\nOr even replacing login top right with [username] [password] [Login] and when \nlogged in it's the usual profile name (username) and Logout .\n\nSince cartoons are on most of the other pages, we should probably continue that \nbrand. A cheater way would be to use the top of /people/ ? And creating an account \nis adding you to the \"people\" and logging in is done by \"people\" so might fit :)\n   \n", "author": "jessica"}, {"message": "bump - does nobody want to discuss this further?\nIf not should we get a mockup/s done?\n   \n", "author": "palhmbs"}, {"message": "I've been thinking, for a start I think \"Relatedly\" is a terrible word to use.\nHow bout \"Login with\", \"Login types\" or \"Login Methods\"  ??\n\nCenter the login to the middle of the screen, instead of just using 1/3 of the \nscreenspace eg: \"Login with a password\".\nPut all the \"Login Methods\" in a top menu / dropdown.\n\nAlso, we should move \"What is OpenID? &amp; \"Forgot your password?\" out of \n\"Relatedly\". \n\nLet's make this login screen spunky....\nCreate a extraneous links free login page (getting rid of site navigation header \nand footer stuff), with no hatch background - Just have the openhatch logo then \nwhen logging in maybe a processing cartoon / gif (aldeka) ?\n\nLooking forward to comments.\nPaul\n   \n", "author": "palhmbs"}, {"message": "It would be totally great if you would think this through.\n\nI have made no progress on this bug because I havne't thought about what a \ngood solution would be.
